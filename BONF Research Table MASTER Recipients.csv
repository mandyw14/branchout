Alice Lui,,Adil Nazarali,The Role of Oxidative Stress in Myelin Degeneration During Aging,"Final Report Project Summary: Myelin is an essential protective wrapping around axons that helps facilitate the transmission of nerve signals. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the myelin sheath can be damaged leaving axons demyelinated and vulnerable to degeneration. Oxidative stress has been shown to be closely associated with neuroinflammation that occurs in MS. This project seeks to understand the relationship between aging, oxidative stress and myelin degeneration. As lipids comprise the majority of the myelin sheath and prone to oxidative damage, I hypothesized that lipid oxidation would increase before protein oxidation, and that these biochemical indicators of oxidative stress would precede myelin degeneration. To investigate the relationship between oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and myelin breakdown, various biochemical assays were performed on different brain regions in aging mice. The Thiobarbituraric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) for lipid peroxidation showed no conclusive linkage between aging and oxidative damage to lipids. However, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) mapping of brain sections indicated alterations in lipid content in the corpus callosum, the major white matter tract connecting the two cerebral hemispheres. In the future, this novel imaging technique can be used as a measure of lipid damage to assess NeuroCAM interventions.","Final Report Lay Summary: Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the protective myelin, surrounding neuronal processes in the central nervous system, is damaged. This leads to a slower propagation of nerve signals, resulting in both motor and sensory deficits.

Kira Leitl ,,Matthew Hill,Endocannabinoid Signalling in Anxiety,"Final Report Project Summary: Various studies have indicated the importance of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in regulating the stress response, and furthermore, acute stress alters eCB levels in several brain regions involved in stress regulation (Morena et al. 2016 Neuropharmacology 41:80- 102; Gray et al. 2015 J Neurosci 35:3879-92). Specifically, the decline of the eCB anandamide (AEA) in various brain regions following acute stress is primarily mediated by increased activity of the degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH; Gray et al. 2015 J Neurosci 35:3879-92). A recent study has shown that activation of p-21 protein activated kinase-1 (PAK1) upregulates the activity of synaptosomal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), another AEA-degrading enzyme, which in turn reduces hippocampal AEA levels (Xia et al. 2016 eLife, 5:e14653). By merging these findings, the present project has explored a novel neural mechanism for the stress-induced decrease in brain AEA levels and the manifestation of anxiety-like behaviour. This project focused on determining whether acute stress induced the activation of PAK1, and whether inhibition of PAK1 would revert the stress-induced AEA decrease and therefore decrease the anxiety response. To address these questions, male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were acutely stressed using a forced swim task (FST) protocol and their anxiety response was evaluated using an elevated plus maze (EPM) protocol. A unilateral cannulation of the intracerebroventricular space permitted the central pharmacological inhibition of PAK1 using the compound IPA-3. The animals were sacrificed for the collection of brain tissue used in protein quantification analyses. Protein quantification was achieved using western blotting analysis to evaluate the presence of activated PAK1 in several stress-regulating brain regions. AEA content was determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. We found that pharmacological inhibition of PAK1 had no effect on AEA levels in the amygdala and trended towards increasing AEA levels in the prefrontal cortex. As well, we found that PAK1 inhibition trended towards increased time spent in the open arms of the EPM post-FST. This indicates that PAK1 inhibition might be effective in alleviating the stress- induced anxiety response. Western blotting analyses are still being conducted to determine if acute stress induced the activation of PAK1.","Final Report Lay Summary: The endocannabinoid system (what Cannabis acts on) is involved in the regulation of the stress response and emotionality. New evidence suggests that activation of p-21 protein activated kinase-1 (PAK1) can alter endocannabinoid signaling in emotional centers of the brain, which can be associated with several brain disorders, including anxiety. The present project seeks to explore the mechanisms by which PAK1 alters endocannabinoid signaling, and helps to evaluate the efficacy of cannabinoid compounds in the treatment of stress-induced anxiety.",,"Stress, pak1, AEA, Inhibition, Response",Anxiety,y,Stress,Cannabis,Anxiety Regulation,Animal,,Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2016,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lgm73d4AAAAJ&hl=en,https://de.linkedin.com/in/kira-leitl-866b36126,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kira-Leitl,,Techinal University of Munich,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myren Sohn,,Matthew Hill,Unraveling Anxiety's Secrets with Endocannabinoids,"Final Report Project Summary: Introduction: Currently, many people who suffer from anxiety disorders self-medicate with cannabis. This seems to reduce anxiety in most, however, some people have reported that cannabis has the effect of increasing anxiety and depressive symptoms. Animal studies have shown that cannabinoid drugs can have distinctly opposite effects depending on the context in which they are administered. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) endocannabinoid system has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of stress and anxiety. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and 2- arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the PFC, differentially regulate anxiety behaviour depending on the level of environment-associated emotional arousal. Methods: Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were tested for anxiety in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). One group was not handled or habituated to the experimental room and tested under high light conditions (High Arousal group; HA), this created environment-associated emotional arousal. The second group was extensively handled and habituated to the experimental room and tested under red light conditions (Low Arousal group; LA). HA and LA rats were given bilateral intra-PFC administration of URB597 (10ng/side), KML29 (0.2ug/side) or their vehicle 30 mins prior to the EPM test. Each EPM test was filmed and scored to assess the effects of each treatment on anxiety behaviour. Rats were then sacrificed for brain dissection and histological analysis to assure proper cannula placement. Results: As was expected, the LA group exhibited a significant lower anxiety behavioral profile as compared to the HA group in the EPM. We also found that URB597 decreased the anxiety response shown by LA rats as compared to the correspondent vehicle group, without affecting emotional behavior in the HA group. KML29 injections did not alter anxiety response in the LA or the HA group. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings show how the endocannabinoid system is differentially activated to regulate the anxiety response, depending on the level of the environment-associated emotional arousal and help to shed light on the neurobiological mechanism involved in the differential impact of stress on emotionality.",Final Report Lay Summary: The endocannabinoid system has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of stress and anxiety. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether this regulation is affected by the level of environment-associated emotional arousal. They investigated this in an animal model through the implementation of cannabinoids in different emotional environments (either high or low levels of arousal). They found that those in an environment with low levels of emotional arousal exhibited less anxiety compared to those in environments with high levels of emotional arousal. This shows that the endocannabinoid system is differentially activated to regulate anxiety depending on one’s environment. This project aids in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the differential impact of stress on emotionality.,,"Anxiety, Group, Arousal, Emotional, Endocannabinoid","""Stress, Anxiety""",y,Endocannabinoid,Environment,Anxiety Regulation,Animal,,Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2017,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=nBYxHk4AAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/myren-sohn-879061195/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Myren-Sohn,,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kyle Mayr,,Patrick Whelan,Ketogenic Diet as an Analgesic Following Injury,"Final Report Project Summary: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic event that effects 86,000 Canadians currently and is continually increasing every year. Physical therapy is one of the most effective ways to promote recovery following SCI but us usually accompanied by chronic pain in the form of neuropathic pain. Pain following SCI becomes a major deterrent in the desire to rehabilitate, forcing many patients to give up on treatment early. Currently, the primary treatment for neuropathic pain is the use of pharmacological opioids. Pharmaceutical use has many inherent issues due to the efficacy per patient, dependency on medications, and the accompanied undesired side effects. This presents a large issue in the clinic because patients are more likely to rehabilitate with pain suppression, but the adverse effects of these drugs may outweigh the reward. I believe that diet may play a large role in pain mediation and specifically, the ketogenic diet may play a large role in reduce perceived pain following spinal cord injury. Our preliminary data shows when isolated spinal cords were perfused in a solution of aCSF with ketone bodies there was an increased amount of dorsal root potentials. These potentials are inhibitory interactions with the spinal cord indicating an increase in inhibitory input into the sensory portion of the spinal cord, indicative of decreased pain signal transmission. Or lab found that when young mice were fed a ketogenic diet following a nerve injury, they did not develop a typical thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, characteristic of a neuropathic pain. In adult mice (C57B/L6) of 3 month of age, I found that they did not have significant differences in mechanical nociception of the hindpaws determined through von frey testing using the verified SUDO method. Furthermore, there was not a significant difference in thermal sensitivity by testing with hot plate test with 20 second removal protocol. Though neither test showed any differences in ketogenic diet vs pellet diet, I found that when animals were introduced to a novel open field, KD animals had increased fast paced locomotor bouts ( >100mm/s) and reduced variability (smaller SD) compared to pellet fed animals. Furthermore, these animals displayed increases in center crossings. Taken together, this is indicative of lowered stress levels, increased activity, leading us to believe that this diet may play a role in the recovery following SCI. To evaluate pain, we have moved to a pain model in collaboration with Dr. Tuan Trang. By using a spared nerve injury (ligation of the common peritoneal and tibial nerves), we have been able to evaluate animals pain sensitivity and motor recovery. We have found that animals with chronic pain have increased sensitivity following injury, increased locomotion, with no significant differences (so far) in motor recovery. This leads us to believe that animals on the diet will increase the frequency self-rehabilitation leading to greater motor recovery in the long term. We have currently finished a large scale, time increased study to look at the physiological changes within the spinal cord. Specifically, we are looking in the lumbar spinal cord to determine the role of microglia following injury. Preliminary results show a decrease in microglia activation at later time points in injured mice, on the ketogenic diet. This finding is indicative of decreased pain. Though this seems to be contradictive to the increased sensitivity we previously found following injury, the current explanation of this exciting result is that animals following injury have greater and earlier sensory recovery following injury. This would indicate that this is not pain, but instead, could be due to increased sprouting in the dorsal horn afferents of the spinal cord re-establishing sensory connectivity. Though these findings are still in their infancy, it is an exciting path that we are currently exploring to elucidate both the mechanistic role of the ketogenic diet as well as the functional changes that come from this diet following injury.",,,"Pain, Diet, Animals, Ketogenic, Sensitivity","""Spinal Cord Injury, Peripheral Nerve Injury""",,Pain,Ketogenic Diet,"Nutrition, Pain Reduction",Human,,Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2017,22000,22000,,,,,,,"22,000.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=YweUFcMAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-mayr/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyle-Mayr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alec Lamb,,Colin Dalton,"Getting on my nerves, but in a good way","Rationale/Impact: Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) have a plethora of causes and often result in significant long-term disabilities.[1][2] Severe PNI that damage the internal structures of an otherwise intact nerve may result in what is referred to as a ‘neuroma in continuity’ (NIC). A NIC results in the abnormal growth of nerve cells, greatly detriments nerve function, and can cause long lasting chronic pain. Recovery from such an injury is often poor and incomplete, burdening healthcare systems and economies with costly and lengthy (potentially multi-year) treatments. Electrical stimulation (ES) is a promising solution being developed to promote nerve regeneration after such injuries, but optimal parameters are unclear (the most common setting being the application of a monophasic square pulse at 3 V amplitude, 0.1 ms pulse width and 20 Hz frequency), and the exact mechanisms underdetermined.[3][4][5] Implantable cuff electrodes are often used to apply this ES, which keep nerves intact, are minimally invasive, and provide structure to the nerve during regeneration.[6][7] In spite of this, researchers studying such nerve regeneration may only evaluate results at the end of treatment, when it may be too late to address any issues. This in turn prevents the optimization of ES, and proactive management of critical nerve regeneration in patients. In light of these gaps, the goal of this project is to develop an implantable cuff which integrates miniaturized electronic printed circuit boards (PCBs) capable of both longitudinally monitoring nerve regeneration after injury, and providing ES to stimulate regeneration. This will be tested by monitoring the fluorescence properties of nerves from green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing rats. Such a device would provide researchers with the tools necessary to dramatically improve outcomes of nerve repair and regeneration. Monitoring nerve regeneration sooner, less disruptively, and in-situ would dramatically improve its optimization and use, while providing concurrent benefits to patients, the healthcare system, and economy. Hypothesis: The regeneration of GFP expressing neurons will vary the intensity and distribution of fluorescence detected over the course of nerve regeneration for a nerve in-vivo undergoing electrical stimulation. Methodology: (1) Device design and assembly. Schematic link in reference [10] PCB for the cuff will be designed/manufactured to include the following wired components: >> A microcontroller unit powering/controlling 4 blue LED’s (to stimulate green emissions from GFP nerves). >> 4 photodiodes which collect fluorescent emission light (whose signals will be digitized by an analog to digital converter, and transmitted by the microcontroller). Molds for the cuffs will be drilled into aluminum blocks and surrounded with tape for a smooth surface. The PCB will be inserted into the mold around a hypodermic needle, and the mold will be filled with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and allowed to set.[9] (2) Device and component characterization. An empty cuff will be employed to select photodiodes/filters which result in the least blue light detection (optimize isolation of green emissions). A cuff containing a specific concentration of Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 488 dye (IAF488 dye) will be used to: >> Optimize emission wavelength from LED’s (~480-490 nm), and photodiode monitoring parameters (~525 nm) >> Confirm functionality of the cuff (more green light is detected than blue). (3) Phantom tests Phantoms containing various concentrations of IAF488 dye (to determine cuff sensitivity) will be injected into the cuff at various positions. LEDs will be turned on for photodiodes to monitor the position of the phantom. The phantom’s actual position will be compared with the data to determine the cuff’s resolution. Similar analysis of cuff performance will be conducted in other solutions at varying concentrations such as saline, blood, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid to emulate in-vivo conditions. Potential challenges, and solutions: 1. Bubble formation within PDMS cuff impacting optical sight. >> Use a centrifuge or vacuum to remove bubbles during production. 2. Diffusion of LED light in solution leading to false readings. >> Utilization of filters (eg. gel) to reduce the probability. 3. Size of components (fitting them onto embedded PCB). >> Ensure only essential components are within the cuff; utilize exterior space for all else. A macro model may be tested first. 4. Data storage. >> Most cuffs will utilize a microcontroller to turn on and off, which contains a small amount of storage space for use. This proposal is a component of a larger study outlined in reference [9] and in the section below. Research following this study will continue to test these methods of nerve monitoring in-vivo, and with ES.","The delivery of electrical stimulation to damaged nerves has been shown to help them heal and regrow. It is difficult to explore this occurrence as conventional tracking of nerve regeneration is invasive, costly, and largely retrospective. This proposal explores the reduction of these limiting factors through continuously monitoring nerve regeneration via optical measurement. This will be done by developing a novel cuff which wraps around a damaged nerve, delivers electrical stimulation, and measures how light is absorbed during regeneration. Such a device would help to dramatically improve outcomes of nerve repair and regeneration, concurrently benefiting patients and the healthcare system.",,"Nerve, Cuff, Regeneration, Light, Monitoring",Peripheral Nerve Injury,n,Myelination,Cuff,"Nerve Repare, Nerve Regeneration",Animal,Translational,Tech,University of Calgary,2020,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-lamb/,,,University of Calgary,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monika Dyjak,,Dave (David) Collins,Comparing Commercial and lab grade non-invasive stimulators for Spinal Cord Injury,"Rational People living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) have a loss of voluntary control of muscles below the area of injury. (1) In addition, living with a SCI is expensive. For instance, someone who is injured at 25 years old and has paralysis in all four limbs, has an estimated associated cost of $2,394,507. (5) Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is an emerging, non-invasive technique being used to reverse some of this paralysis for those with SCI (2). In a single session, tSCS has been shown to restore movement in upper and lower limbs that were once thought to be permanently paralyzed. After a short rehabilitation period using tSCS, people with a complete SCI have been shown to regain voluntary control of hand muscles, even when the tSCS is turned off (3) It is hypothesized that the remarkable improvements are due to the spinal neurons ability to adapt, increasing both fine movement and overall muscle force. (3,4) In a recent study, tSCS was administered through electrodes placed on the back of the neck with “return” or ground electrodes placed on the hips (4). They then increased the tSCS intensity in order to assist or augment the weak voluntary commands from the brain. After two 15-30-minute sessions a week, participants showed a significant increase in maximum hand grip force and hand strength. (4) The increases in function allowed for an increase of daily tasks to be completed. Although the improvements are significant, the costs of the stimulators that are currently being used are high are very high, making therapy and research an expensive, often unattainable, endeavour. The purpose of my project is to compare an affordable, commercially available, stimulator, to the expensive “gold standard” stimulator, that is only currently available for research. We will compare functional outcomes between two group of participants with a SCI, each of which will use a different stimulator. Our overall hypothesis, based on previous data, is that outcomes will be better in the group using the commercially-available stimulator than the “gold-standard. Overall, I hope to find a cheaper alternative to present tSCS therapy, allowing everyone to see the benefits of this therapy. Methods Regarding tSCS, we are going to compare the commercially-available Neurodyn Neuromuscular Stimulator (300 USD) with the NeoStim 5 (10 000 USD). In our proposed study, we will compare the efficacy of the two stimulators regarding fine motor movement and hand strength rehabilitation for people with high level SCIs. Over a ten-week trial, people with a non-progressive, C5 or higher injuries will be recruited and be administered 30 minutes of stimulation of either box, while performing grasp exercises. Simulating electrodes will be placed on the back of the neck near the fifth cervical vertebrae, with grounding electrodes on the anterior superior iliac crest. Electromyographic (EMG) recording electrodes will be placed on forearm flexors and extensors to record the electrical activity of the muscles. Grasp force will be measured before, during and after stimulation during each session using EMG activity. In addition, both intervention groups will be evaluated through Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) before intervention, on week 5 and week 10. Stimulation will be increased until muscle contraction is seen and will stay on for a period of 30 minutes. A 10 kHz waveform will be used from the NeoStim and 2 kHz waveform from the Neurodyn Neuromuscular Stimulator. Participants will be recruited through the Steadward Centre for Personal & Physical Achievement, as well as the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton Alberta. Specific Hypotheses 1. ARAT and maximal grip strength will increase significantly after using both stimulators. 2. ARAT and maximal grip strength will increase significantly more in the group using the Neurodyn Stimulator. Potential impact for this project If the hypotheses hold true, it allows for the potential to increase SCI rehabilitation research and increase accessible rehabilitation care that can be administered in the comfort of someone’s home. It can increase research due to the significant decrease of cost, meaning, more resources can be used towards administering stimulation and recruiting more individuals to take part of these studies than on purchasing the equipment itself. In addition, due to its low cost and easy set-up, those experiencing SCI could administer it to themselves with non-trained assistance through prescription of a rehabilitation expert. Although both time and money would be saved with the benefits of increasing motor function, it’s the improvements in the quality of life for people living with the consequences of a SCI that are most important, and most rewarding.","Spinal cord injuries are thought to be permanent, debilitating and costly. One of the worst consequences is paralysis below where the spinal cord is injured. However, new research is emerging. There have been studies showing that by placing electrical stimulation on the skin over the spinal cord can cause voluntary movements that wasn’t possible before. In my experiment, I will be using that technique but comparing two boxes, one costing $308.01 and the other $10 000. My goal is to see if the cheaper device can cause the same or better movement as the more expensive box.",tSCS,"tSCS, Stimulation, Electrodes, Strength, Rehabilitation",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Neuroplasticity,Eletrical Stimulation,Technology Effectiveness,Human,Translational,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Alberta,2020,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-dyjak-376204205/,,,,F45 Training,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bradi Lorenz,,Lynda Mainwaring,Girl Power: Can Menstrual Hormones protect the Female Brain after Concussion?  ,"Rationale: Sport related concussion (SRC) is a traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by biomechanical forces that typically results in acute clinical signs and symptoms that largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than a structural injury (7). Recovery most frequently occurs between 1-3 weeks after injury but some individuals may take months before they are medically cleared to return-to-play (RTP) (2, 6, 7). Although most SRC research has primarily focused on male athletes, a growing body of research suggests that women have a higher incidence of SRC than men playing sports with similar rules, such as ice hockey, soccer, or basketball (4, 11). It has also been suggested that women have worse outcomes and longer time to RTP than men following concussion (11). While the underlying mechanisms for these differences is unclear, they may be related to sex and gender differences in both injury onset and recovery. Previous studies suggest that women frequently miss menstrual periods or experience total amenorrhea after concussion, suggesting postinjury deficits in sex hormones (8). With respect to neuroendocrine function, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis becomes suppressed after TBI, ultimately decreasing luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone, and estrogen concentrations (1, 2). Progesterone concentration varies predictably during the menstrual cycle, with the highest concentration during the luteal phase (LP), and the lowest concentration during the follicular phase (FP). Also, many women take hormonal forms of birth control which work by providing constant high levels of synthetic progestins. Sex hormones, specifically estrogen and progesterone, may be neuroprotective, and their sudden withdrawal after injury may be the key factor contributing to worse outcomes in women (11). Wunderle et al. suggest that women who suffer a concussion in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle, when progesterone is highest, may suffer from subsequent progesterone withdrawal leading to lower neurological outcomes and quality of life at one month post injury (11). Previous work in our lab has shown that there is a significant negative relationship between days to medical clearance and progesterone concentration in both male and female athletes (2). Di Battista et al. also found that progesterone was associated with the somatic, cognitive, fatigue, and emotion symptom clusters (2). That is, decreases in progesterone were correlated with increases in concussion symptoms. Progesterone may be a potential therapeutic target following concussion as it may reduce cerebral edema and blood brain barrier disruption, limit oxidative stress and inflammation post-injury, and improve mood and behavior (2, 9, 10). The current study will investigate the roles estrogen, progesterone, birth control, and menstrual cycle phase play in both concussion incidence and recovery in female athletes. The relationships between female sex hormones and symptom profiles will also be examined to see if they influence time to medical clearance. Hypotheses: (1) The greatest number of concussions will be sustained during the luteal phase of menstruation when progesterone concentration is high. (2) Female athletes who suffer a concussion during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle will then have longer time to medical clearance than women injured during the follicular phase of their cycle or women taking oral contraceptives. (3) Due to withdrawal after injury, lower progesterone and estrogen concentrations will be related to increases in number and severity of symptoms in all clusters – somatic, cognitive, fatigue, and emotion. Potential Impact: Associations between hormone concentrations and concussion incidence and outcome have important implications for treatment and prognosis after injury. While this study will be conducted on female university athletes, it could have implications for a wide range of people. Therefore, the results of this study could help guide further research about hormone concentrations and concussion outcomes in many different populations. This study may also have implications in the development of progesterone as a potential therapeutic target following TBI in females. Methods: Athletes are eligible for participation in the current study as part of a larger multi-year study being conducted at a single academic institution (2). Athletes with SRC will be enrolled at the time of their injury: blood will be taken within seven days of an SRC. Concussion diagnosis will be performed by a sport medicine physician at an academic sport medicine clinic, in accordance with the Concussion in Sport Group statement (7). Medical clearance for unrestricted activity (i.e., clinical recovery) to be determined by a physician with expertise in sport and exercise medicine from a single institution. Blood samples are to be taken between 11:00 am and 6:00 pm. Venous blood will be drawn into 10-mL K2EDTA and 4-mL serum vacutainers (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA), where it will equilibrate for approximately one hour at room temperature, followed by a two minute centrifugation using a PlasmaPrep 12TM centrifuge (Separation Technology Inc., FL, USA). The supernatant will then be aliquoted and frozen at -70°C until analysis. Blood concentrations of hormones will be quantitated by solid-phase chemiluminescent immunoassay via the Immulite 1000 analyzer (Siemens Healthineers Global, Erlangen, Germany). The Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) will be administered to all athletes at the time of blood draw. The PCSS is a 22-item symptom inventory checklist using a seven-point scale rating included in the most recent Sport Concussion Assessment Tool version 5 (SCAT-5) (5). Symptoms are to be clustered into four categories for statistical analysis: somatic (headache, pressure in head, neck pain, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, balance problems, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise), cognitive (feeling slowed down, feeling “in a fog”, “don’t feel right”, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, confusion), fatigue and sleep problems (fatigue/low energy, drowsiness, trouble falling asleep) and emotion (more emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous/anxious) (3). A correlational analysis will be used to evaluate the relationship between hormones, symptom clusters, and days to physician medical clearance.","Female athletes have a higher risk for and worse outcomes following concussion than male athletes while also reporting an increased number and severity of concussion symptoms. While the underlying mechanisms for these differences are unclear, they may be related to sex and gender differences in both injury onset and recovery. This study will examine the relationships between physiological and psychological symptoms, hormonal influences, and concussion outcomes. Specifically, they will investigate the role of menstrual cycle phase, use of birth control, and the corresponding influences on somatic, cognitive, fatigue, and emotional symptoms as they relate to concussion outcomes in female athletes.",,"Progesterone, Athletes, Women, Cycle, Menstrual, Hormones","""Concussion, TBI""",y,Hormones,Preventative,Rehabilitaiton,Human,"Basic, Translational",Mind and Body,University of Toronto,2020,22000,22000,,,,,,,"22,000.00","22,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradi-rai-lorenz-b66015317/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bradi-Lorenz,,"University of British Columbia, University of Alberta",,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maryam Faiz, Kathryn Todd",,"Maryam Faiz, Kathryn Todd",Feeding your Microbiome for Brain Health,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in Canada. Ischemic stroke comprises around 80% of all strokes1. It is caused by a reduction of blood flow to the brain that results in neural cell death and inflammation, and consequent deficits in function. Unfortunately, current treatments are limited and can only be administered in a fraction of patients due to a very narrow therapeutic time window [2]. As a result, the majority of stroke survivors have significant functional impairments. It is becoming increasingly evident that the microbiota-gut-brain-axis (interaction between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS)) is an important determinant in the progression and outcome of a number of CNS conditions [3,4], including stroke [5,6]. More specifically, recent studies have shown that stroke causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which can influence neuroinflammation and negatively impacts functional outcome5. Thus, commensal gut bacteria and their metabolic by-products are a promising new therapeutic target for stroke. Stroke and neuroinflammation: In the acute phase of stroke, dying neurons release death associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as reactive oxygen species. DAMP release promotes the activation of CNS glial cells, microglia, which phagocytose debris and release pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1ß and TNF) that promote further damage. In addition, activated microglia produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that compromise the integrity of the blood-brain-barrier. In addition to glial cells, the release of DAMPs and cytokines into systemic circulation promotes the recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the lesion site6. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lymphocytes derived from gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) migrate to the ischemic lesion to exert their effector functions [5]. Taken together, the contributions of resident CNS immune cells and gut-derived immune cells should be considered when developing immunomodulatory interventions for stroke. Post-stroke dysbiosis and stroke outcomes: Recent studies have shown that stroke is associated with gut dysbiosis. Using 16S RNA V4 hypervariable region sequencing, it has been shown that stroke causes a reduction in bacterial species and an increase in the ratio of Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes [5,6]. These changes in the composition of the gut microbiota have a significant impact on immune cells. It has been demonstrated that the post-stroke gut microbiota polarizes inflammatory T cell subsets that are observed both in the intestine and the injured region of the brain [5,7].The impact of the post-stroke gut microbiota on resident CNS immune cells, such as microglia, has yet to be characterized, and offers an exciting avenue for discovery. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the gut microbiota can influence functional recovery after stroke; transplantation of the post-stroke fecal microbiome into germ-free mice prior to stroke exacerbates symptom severity and worsens functional outcomes [5]. Overall, it is clear the inflammatory response that results from the interaction of the post-stroke gut microbiota and the host immune system is a potential target for the development of novel therapeutics for enhanced post-stroke recovery. Microbiota-derived metabolites and stroke repair: The gut dysbiosis that results from stroke produces a consequent change in the levels of gut microbiota-derived metabolites. These can directly signal to the CNS or indirectly influence the CNS via altering peripheral immune homeostasis and immune responses [7,9]. One important microbiota-derived metabolite is butyric acid, a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by dietary fibre fermentation. In animal models of stroke, fecal and serum levels of butyric acid are reduced following injury [8]. A few recent studies have shown a positive effect of butyric acid treatment on stroke outcomes, using both pre- and post-stroke treatment paradigms. Sodium butyrate treatment in the acute phase post-injury reduces blood brain barrier permeability and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, which results in reduced lesion size and functional deficits [9]. Similarly, pre-treatment with SCFAs, including butyrate, leads to an upregulation of microglial activation genes and synaptic pruning, and is associated with functional recovery [10]. Currently, the effect of SCFAs on gut-derived lymphocytes that respond to stroke is unknown. However, gut derived SCFAs have been shown to promote the differentiation of naïve T cells into T regulatory cells that suppress inflammation [11]. These findings suggest that the synergistic effects of bacterial metabolites on gut derived lymphocytes and CNS resident immune cells may mediate the therapeutic effect of gut microbiota-based strategies for stroke. Sex differences in microbiota and stroke outcomes: As with other preclinical models of neuroinflammation, published literature using stroke models are limited in that most studies have failed to explore sex differences. This lack of consideration is particularly problematic as men and women show significant differences in stroke prevalence, incidence, and mortality [12] that are amplified over the lifespan. In the aged population, strokes are more prevalent and associated with worse prognoses in women [12,13]. In addition, there are observed sex differences in the phenotype of peripheral immune cells and microglia in the context of ischemic stroke [14,15], but these findings have not been considered in the context of therapeutic development. Further to this, most studies of gut microbiota-based interventions for stroke have been conducted using male mice despite evidence that there are clear differences in the microbiota of males and females throughout the lifespan [16]. Addressing this disparity is in line with recommendations from the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) to include males and females in preclinical studies, to ensure robust preclinical data and reduce the failure of translational research [17]. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of butyrate treatment on the gut microbiota composition in males and female mice. We hypothesize that there will be differences in butyrate production post- stroke in males and females and a differential response to butyrate treatment following stroke. Post- stroke levels of butyrate will be analysed using mass spectrometry, and the composition of the post- stroke gut microbiota will be characterized using 16S V4 hypervariable region sequencing. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effect of butyrate treatment on the neuroinflammatory response in male and female mice. We hypothesize that butyrate will differentially affect the male and female post-stroke immune response. We will examine microglial pathology and gut-derived immune cell infiltration in vivo after stroke and butyrate treatment in male and female mice. We will further examine microglial inflammatory response to butyrate in vitro in primary cultures derived from male and female mice. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of butyrate treatment on functional outcomes following stroke in male and female mice using a battery of behavioural tests for motor function. We hypothesize that males and females will show differences in functional outcomes in response to butyrate treatment. Animals: 8-week-old male and female C57/Bl6 mice, purchased from Charles River will be used in all experiments. It has been shown that the microbiota is stable at this age [18]. To reduce variation due to cage effects [19], we will house mice in cages of 2 and mix bedding prior to the experiment. Stroke-injury: We will use the endothelin-1 model of stroke [20–22]. In this model, ET-1, a potent vasoconstrictor is injected into the sensory motor cortex to induce ischemia and reperfusion. ET-1 stroke recapitulates many of the pathological process of human ischemic stroke. We have previously used this model to characterize changes in the microbiota and shown differential dysbiosis in males and females. Sham injured mice, will be used as controls. Butyrate treatment: Butyrate will be intragastrically administered for 14d [post stroke day (PSD) 1-14] immediately following stroke. Control mice will be given saline. Aim 1. To determine the effect of butyrate treatment on the gut microbiota composition in males and female mice. Aim 1.1:. Previous work has shown a reduction in butyrate post-stroke in males as early as 24 hours post injury. To determine whether stroke also changes the level of butyrate production in females, we will extract the cecal contents from male and female stroke- injured mice and sham-injured controls at acute and subacute time points: PSD 1, 4, and 7. Mass spectrometry will be performed in collaboration with CAGEF at the University of Toronto, which will allow us to establish sex-specific levels of butyric acid following stroke. Aim 1.2: To determine sex-specific shifts in microbiota following butyrate treatment (two weeks, PSD 1-14), we will collect fecal samples from male and female stroke-injured butyrate-treated mice. Stroke-injured saline-treated and sham-injured butyrate-treated male and female mice will be used as controls. We will collect fecal samples from mice prior to stroke, on PSD 7 (the first time when we see dysbiosis in stroke-injured males and females), PSD 14 (at the end of treatment), PSD 21 (1 week after treatment), and PSD 42 (one month after treatment). To characterize the gut microbiota, gDNA will be extracted from samples and 16s rRNA V4 hypervariable region sequencing will be performed using the Illumina Miseq platform in collaboration with CAGEF at the University of Toronto. The resulting sequences will be processed using the Qiime [2] bioinformatics pipeline [23]. Alpha diversity, beta diversity [23] and Linear discriminant effect size analyses [24] will be used to identify differences in the average species diversity, bacterial communities, and the bacterial genera, respectively, in male and females following treatment. Aim 2.1: We will perform stroke and butyrate treatment as in Aim 1.2. To examine sex differences in the response of intestinal immune cells that migrate to the stroke lesion we will dissociate the small intestine lamina propria of male and female stroke-injured butyrate-treated mice and characterize these cells using flow cytometry panels for B, T, and myeloid cells at PSD 7 (one week after treatment) and PSD 14 (at the end of treatment). In addition, we will characterize immune cells that traffic from the gut to brain [5,25] by pre-labelling cells in the gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) CFSE one week prior to stroke. We will characterize the profile of CFSE+ immune cells using flow cytometry (as above) that are found in the injured brain region at PSD 7 (after 1 week of treatment) and PSD 14 (at the end of treatment). Stroke-injured saline-treated and sham-injured butyrate treated animals will be used as controls. Aim 2.2: We will examine sex differences in microglial inflammation in vivo following butyrate treatment using immunofluorescence microscopy. Microglia are rapidly activated following stroke injury [26].We will examine microglia in the stroke penumbra of male and female mice at PSD 1, 4, and 7. Microglia will be identified using the myeloid marker ionized Ca2+-binding adapter protein-1 (Iba1), visualized with confocal microscopy, and quantified using a skeleton analysis to determine morphological correlates of inflammatory activity [27]. Stroke-injured saline-treated and sham-injured butyrate treated animals will be used as controls. Aim 2.3 Direct sex dependent effects of butyrate on microglial inflammation will be determined in vitro using primary cultures of microglia from CX3CR1+/eGFP mice 28,29. In CX3CR1+/eGFP mice, microglia (CXC3CR1+) express GFP. Primary cultures will be prepared from the whole brain of postnatal day 2 male and female littermates. Isolated male and female microglia will be treated with butyrate (or a saline control) and stimulated with the cytokine interferon-γ to induce a pro- inflammatory state, and the inflammatory response will be determined by measuring cytokine production, nitric oxide release, phagocytic capacity, and motility. Aim 3: To examine whether butyrate treatment can lead to recovery following stroke, we will induce stroke as in Aims 1 and 2 and perform behavioural testing and lesion volume analysis. We will perform motor behavioural testing (i.e. horizontal ladder rung [30] and cylinder task [31]) pre and post butyric acid treatment to examine whether sex differences in the effects of butyrate drives differences in functional recovery. Using the ET-1 model of stroke, we have observed significant deficits using both the ladder and cylinder tasks at PSD4 that persist until PSD35 (the latest analyzed time-point), making this model appropriate for testing therapeutic efficacy. As such, we will perform behavioural testing at baseline, at PSD4, PSD14, PSD21, and PSD35. We will compare post-injury outcomes to baseline performance (within group) and between the following groups: uninjured controls, sham-injured and stroke-injured butyrate-treated, and stroke-injured control treated mice.","Stroke is a devastating disease that affects 50,000 Canadians every year that causes inflammation and injury in the brain, yet there are currently no effective treatments to reduce functional impairments after injury. Recently, it has been discovered that types of bacteria in the gut can change the outcomes of stroke. In particular, gut bacteria can produce a number of compounds that pass through the blood to influence the immune response in the brain. It has been shown that stroke reduces the bacterial by-product butyrate in the gut, and this is associated with worse inflammation in the brain and poorer functional outcomes. This has generated interest in replenishing butyrate as a potential therapeutic approach for inflammation after stroke. Interestingly, males and females show differences in the types of bacteria in the human gut. It is also well known that males and females show differences in functional outcomes following stroke. Similar sex differences have been observed in immune cell responses to stroke. However, it is unknown whether sex differences in the gut can influence recovery after stroke. More specifically, whether males and females respond differently to butyrate treatment following stroke is unknown. We will treat male and female mice with butyrate following stroke to determine how treatment changes the profile of gut bacteria and the gut-mediated post-stroke inflammatory response. We will then assess whether this results in differential functional outcomes following treatment in males and females. This research will be the first to examine how butyrate supplementation can change the inflammatory response and whether sex is a variable in the efficacy of this treatment.",,"Butyrate, Mice, Microbiota, Cells, Immune",Stroke,n,Inflammation,Butyrate,Stroke Recovery,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Toronto,2020,50000,50000,,,,,,,"50,000.00","50,000.00",SPG,SPG,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=lx2xu4cAAAAJ&hl=en,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryam-faiz-253a9657/ , https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-todd-75a6a878/ ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maryam-Faiz , https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kathryn-G-Todd-39457154 ","https://www.faiz-lab.com , https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/toddlab/home ","Univeristy of Toronto, University of Alberta",,,,"maryam.faiz@utoronto.ca , kgtodd@ualberta.ca",0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thomas Worthington,,"Robin Green, Asaf Gilboa",Patient Feasibility for Spatial Navigation Intervention,"Rationale: Memory impairment is one of the most commonly reported and debilitating symptoms among individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI; 1) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS; 2). Our lab has developed a spatial navigation intervention where individuals with TBI and MS learn to navigate and create a cognitive map of different cities each week on Google Street View for 16 weeks. The intervention aims to provide participants with a novel and continuously challenging virtual environment from home in order to stimulate the hippocampus, a key brain area for navigation and memory, to stave off memory decline and hippocampal degeneration, which have unfortunately been observed in both populations (3-7). Previous studies have shown that self-efficacy, or one’s perceived ability to perform a task, is highly predictive of actual performance on the task itself, including cognitive tasks (8-10). This suggests that one’s navigation ability and memory strength may also be mediated by self-perceived navigation ability and perceived memory impairment. Moreover, positive mood has been associated with increased performance on an intensive cognitive intervention for survivors of another neurological disorder, stroke, whereas low mood was associated with low performance and increased frustration with the task itself (11). Anxiety has also been shown to negatively influence visuospatial working memory in stroke survivors even without severe cognitive impairment (12). This makes sense because studies utilizing more advanced functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the brain have elucidated that anxiety in exceeding amounts activates the amygdala, which inhibits activation and plasticity in the hippocampus to be able to encode, store and retrieve information (13). Withiel et al. (2018) demonstrated that self-reported fatigue was not a mediating factor on performance on an in-person memory intervention, though interestingly fatigue was a mediating factor in an online cognitive training intervention. Given the computerized nature of our assessment, fatigue may be a relevant mediating factor in performance on our memory outcome measures. Further factors, such as low sense of mastery (i.e. the perceptions of one’s life circumstances being out of one’s own control; 14) and cognitive reserve (i.e. mind’s resilience following injury or disease; 15) have been shown to characterize responders compared to non- responders to rehabilitation programs for other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and TBI (16). While this literature can help us to speculate which factors may have contributed to some individuals benefitting from our intervention more than others, there seems to be a dearth of literature looking specifically at hippocampus-dependent memory interventions in MS and TBI patient populations. Hence, the overarching aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the factors that determine whether or not a patient with progressive MS or moderate-severe TBI will benefit from our spatial navigation intervention. Objective 1: To complete a secondary analysis of existing data in order to identify predictors of response to treatment. Here, participants will be divided into responders and non-responders according to performance on our primary navigation and memory outcomes (i.e, the Cognitive Map Formation task (17), Pointing task(18), and the Different Directions task (medium transfer; 19), the Mnemonic Similarities task and Memory Image Completion task (far transfer; 20,21)). Responders and nonresponders will be compared to one another prior to treatment on a series of variables that have been shown to predict response to treatment in behavioural intervention studies, namely self efficacy, mood, anxiety, and fatigue. Hypothesis 1: The responder group will show higher self-efficacy and mood, and lower anxiety and fatigue at baseline than the non-responder group. Objective 2: To carry out a structured clinical interview with all responders and non-responders, as described above, to administer a series of outcome measures by telephone that have been shown to predict response to treatment, namely, the Desire to Complete Intervention Scale (22), Sense of Mastery Scale (23), and the Lifestyle Activities Questionnaire (to assess cognitive reserve; 24). Hypothesis 2: The responder group will show a higher desire to complete the intervention, a higher sense of mastery, and engage in more cognitively stimulating lifestyle activities than nonresponders. Methods Participants: Adults with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and adults who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have completed 16 weeks of a spatial navigation training intervention. Outcome measures Classification of patients into responders/nonresponders: 1. Self-efficacy (Everyday Memory Questionnaire(25), Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale(26)), Mood (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 [DASS-21]; 27), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS];28), Anxiety (DASS-21, HADS, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; 29), and Fatigue (Modified Fatigue Index Scale; 30). 2. Desire to Complete Intervention Scale (22), Sense of Mastery Scale (23), Community Integration Questionnaire (24), Quality of Community Integration Questionnaire (24), and Lifestyle Activities Questionnaire (24). Design This study is divided into two parts: the first being a retrospective secondary analysis, and the second being a prospective qualitative clinical interview with additional questionnaires. Procedures Older adult TBI participants were recruited from various sources, including Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) Brain Injury inpatient unit and Sunnybrook Hospital. MS participants were recruited from TRI MS outpatient clinic. Patients were consented for the original study by telephone. No further consent is needed to fulfill objective 1. In regards to Objective2, pending Ethics approval, I will call participants to ask if they would like to complete a follow-up telephone interview to inquire about their experience with the intervention. Analyses Retrospective: Multiple two-sample t-tests will be carried out between the response group and the nonresponse group on their measurements of self efficacy (EMQ, Sense of Direction), mood and anxiety (DASS 21, STAI, HADS), and fatigue (MFIS). Prospective: Multiple two-sample t-tests will be carried out between the response group and the nonresponse group on their measurements of their desire to complete the intervention (Desire to Complete Intervention Scale), sense of mastery (Sense of Mastery Scale), community integration and quality of community integration (Community Integration Questionnaire and Quality of Community Integration Questionnaire), and cognitive reserve (Lifestyle Activities Questionnaire).","Memory issues are a debilitating symptom experience by individuals with traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. Our lab has developed an online intervention where individuals learn how to navigate a new city each week in Google Streetview. Navigation has been shown to increase the size of the hippocampus, an important memory structure in the brain, thus leading to memory benefits. This project is to determine why some participants did not see memory benefits. Some potential causes include low mood, anxiety, fatigue, low self-efficacy (belief in one’s capabilities), and low desire to complete the intervention, to name a few.",,"Memory, Scale, Anxiety, Cognitive, Fatigue","""Multiple Sclerosis, TBI""",n,"Neuroplasticity, Memory",Cognitive Training,Mobility,Human,"Translational, Clinical Trial","Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2020,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcworthington/,,,York University,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,
Andy (Dongkwun) Lee,,Vivian Mushahwar,"One small shock to the spinal cord, one large step for spinal cord injury patients","Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurological trauma that often results from motor vehicle accidents. Currently, SCIs affects ~86,000 people in Canada. Globally, 250,000 to 500,000 people incur an SCI each year (Noonan, 2012; WHO 2013). Most patients experience incomplete tetraplegia (47.2%), followed by incomplete paraplegia (20.4%). Less than 1% of patients experience complete neurological recovery by the time of their hospital discharge (NSCISC, 2018). This low rate of recovery is due to the spinal cord’s limited capacity to regenerate. The limited recovery after SCI results in enormous healthcare costs: the lifetime care expenses for a 25-year-old person with paraplegia are estimated to be $2.3 million (NSCISC, 2018). Intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) is a novel form of electrical stimulation used to treat SCIs (Holinski et al, 2016). A recent study showed that prolonged exposure to ISMS can improve motor skills for weeks after the discontinuation of ISMS (Moritz et al, 2017). The same study suggested that the combination of pharmacological agents and ISMS may strengthen synapses and enhance plasticity after SCI (Mortiz et al, 2017). Nonetheless, there is currently a lack of research on the impact of ISMS on neural reorganization within the spinal cord after SCI. In this project, I will examine the extent of neuroregeneration induced by ISMS in combination with training walking on a horizontal ladder, a skilled walking task (Metz and Whishaw, 2009), in rats with SCI. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats will be divided into four groups: 1) spinally-intact rats, 2) rats with hemisection SCI (hSCI), 3) rats with hSCI and passive ISMS implants, and 4) rats with hSCI and active ISMS implants. All groups will be trained to walk on the horizontal ladder, and their performance will be quantified. The first two groups will provide a baseline of the performance on the horizontal walking task by neurologically-intact rats and rats with hSCI, respectively. The third group will evaluate the effect of the ISMS implant itself on the performance of hSCI rats, and the fourth group will evaluate the improvements in performance in the task when training is combined with stimulation through the ISMS implant. To induce an hSCI, the rats will be anesthetized and a small portion of the bone in the back will be removed to expose the T8 segment of the spinal cord. The cord will then be partially cut on one side, and the surgical site will be sutured shut. After a 2-week recovery period, the rats in groups 3 and 4 will receive an ISMS implant. An array of 4 ultra-fine wires will be implanted in the ventral grey- matter of T13 and L1. One-week post-implant, low-level, sub-motor threshold stimulation through the ISMS implant will be initiated in the rats in group 4. Stimulation will be delivered for 1 hour/day for 4 weeks, coupled with walking training on the horizontal ladder. The walking performance of all rats in groups 1- 4 on the horizontal ladder will be video recorded twice per week and analyzed after blinding to group allocation. At the end of the experiment, all rats will be euthanized, and the spinal cord will be extracted for immunohistochemical processing to assess the anatomical correlates of functional recovery. Synaptophysin and Protein 43 labelling will be analyzed to evaluate axonal sprouting and synaptic reorganization. I will begin my summer training by analyzing the biomechanics and immunohistochemistry from rats used in preliminary experiments. I will then collect my data from experiments performed in this project and investigate the role of ISMS in enhancing axonal sprouting and synaptic connectivity, and improving functional recovery after hSCI. Academic Impact: Discovering the impact of ISMS therapy on the traumatized spinal cord has the potential to spur the discovery of new patient-care technologies. If successful, ISMS may be a viable approach for improving the ability of persons with SCI to stand up and walk again. This could significantly improve the quality of life after SCI and reduce the medical resources associated with SCIs. Furthermore, with a combination of pharmacological agents, ISMS, and rehabilitation training, persons with SCI may achieve better recovery than possible with each treatment alone (Mortiz, 2018). Additionally, with the advent of stem cell use, the simultaneous use of ISMS may allow stem cells to migrate towards the site of injury to support damaged neurons or create a new neural network (Mortiz et al, 2017). The current project provides a pivotal understanding of the extent to which ISMS reorganizes neuronal connectivity, paving the way for future combinations with stem cell therapy.","Up to 500,000 people incur a spinal cord injury globally each year. This often causes loss of functions below the level of injury, and 1% of patients fully recover. Intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS), a novel electrical stimulation technique, has in animals been able to restore mobility by stimulating their spinal cord. ISMS has also been linked with neural regeneration. This project will investigate the extent of neural regeneration induced by ISMS in rats with spinal cord injury. Functional recovery will be assessed by evaluating their ability to walk, and the formation of new neural connections will be assessed using immunohistochemistry.",,"ISMS, Rats, Recovery, Training, Walking, Performance",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Neuroplasticity,Robotic,Rehabilitaiton,Animal,Translational,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Alberta,2020,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=22tM86cAAAAJ&hl=en,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-d-lee/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andy-Lee-76 ,,University of Toronto,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jan Elaine Soriano,,Aaron Phillips,Understanding how Electrical Stimulation balances Blood Pressure in Spinal Cord Injury,"Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction following spinal cord injury (SCI) is a potentially life-threatening condition that leads to chronic blood pressure (BP) instability, which damages the vasculature and heart. Most SCI patients experience several drastic BP fluctuations daily, and rank this as a more important healthcare priority than walking-again [1]. There is an urgent need for new therapeutics to manage sympathetic control of BP after SCI. Our work showed that electrical stimulation of the spinal cord caudal to the injury (eSTIM) acutely modulates BP in humans [2]. We then took these benchside findings back into the rodent model and revealed the mechanistic underpinning of this effect. We harnessed this knowledge to develop closed- loop control technology to mimic natural sympathetic circuit activation. This system functions as a “neuroprosthetic baroreflex”, reinstating natural hemodynamics after SCI including and effectively preventing orthostatic hypotension (OH) [3]. Although our system effectively controls BP by activating sympathetic neurons, our pilot indicates that eSTIM is not specific to sympathetic neurons responsible for (BP). eSTIM unfortunately elicits unintended effects on other autonomic systems such as urogenital functions. OBJECTIVE: Utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify vasomotor-specific sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), and to stabilize BP in vasomotor-specific marker gene knock-in Cre-dependent transgenic mouse line with optoelectronics after SCI by only targeting vasomotor SPNs. Aim 1. To characterize the transcriptional profile of sympathetic pre-ganglionic neuron subtypes, and to identify those that are responsible for selective regulation of vasomotor tone using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Methods: We will perturb sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons using our orthostatic stimulus (i.e., lower-body negative pressure chamber) in uninjured mice to reveal the subpopulations most activated. For this we will perform snRNA-seq and cell type prioritization using our newly developed tool Augur [4,5]. We will confirm the activation of prioritized populations using retrograde viral tracing as well as multiplexed in-situ hybridization of immediate early genes (e.g., Fos, Arc) and key marker genes. Finally, we will complement this activity-labelled approach by also sequencing trans-synaptically-labeled sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in Chat-IRES- Cre::CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice as an orthogonal approach to identify the transcriptional markers of the sympathetic pre-ganglionic neuron subtypes containing the viral constructs[6]. Aim 2: To understand whether optogenetic stimulation of the hemodynamic hotspot can be harnessed to stabilize blood pressure after SCI. Methods: We will use an optoelectronic system purposefully designed to deeply penetrate the spinal cord. We will test whether optogenetic stimulation of sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in the hemodynamic hotspot induces pressor responses. Next, to further enhance the precision of this approach we will use intersectional genetics whereby a Cre and FlpO (a discrete recombinase to Cre) dependent virus will be injected into mice harboring Cre expression in ChATON neurons and Flp in the neuronal subtype identified in Aim 2, and the response to optoelectronic stimulation assessed [7]. Finally, we will test whether optogenetic stimulation of either ChATON neurons or vasomotor- specific sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons induces pressor responses that can be controlled in closed loop. SIGNIFICANCE: This project will provide new basic science understanding of the sympathetic nervous system in the context of hemodynamic stability and SCI. Over the long-term this knowledge will help precision medical management of sympathetic dysfunction across pathologies. Findings will be disseminated to the scientific and general groups through impactful publications, conference presentations and media. We will also continue to develop to commercially-viable intellectual property through patents.","Spinal cord injured individuals report unconscious bodily functions such as those of the cardiovascular system (e.g., orthostatic hypotension) as top health issues.

Jan Elaine Soriano,,Aaron Phillips,Understanding how Electrical Stimulation balances Blood Pressure in Spinal Cord Injury,"Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction following spinal cord injury (SCI) is a potentially life-threatening condition that leads to chronic blood pressure (BP) instability, which damages the vasculature and heart. Most SCI patients experience several drastic BP fluctuations daily, and rank this as a more important healthcare priority than walking-again [1]. There is an urgent need for new therapeutics to manage sympathetic control of BP after SCI. Our work showed that electrical stimulation of the spinal cord caudal to the injury (eSTIM) acutely modulates BP in humans [2]. We then took these benchside findings back into the rodent model and revealed the mechanistic underpinning of this effect. We harnessed this knowledge to develop closed- loop control technology to mimic natural sympathetic circuit activation. This system functions as a “neuroprosthetic baroreflex”, reinstating natural hemodynamics after SCI including and effectively preventing orthostatic hypotension (OH) [3]. Although our system effectively controls BP by activating sympathetic neurons, our pilot indicates that eSTIM is not specific to sympathetic neurons responsible for (BP). eSTIM unfortunately elicits unintended effects on other autonomic systems such as urogenital functions. OBJECTIVE: Utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify vasomotor-specific sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), and to stabilize BP in vasomotor-specific marker gene knock-in Cre-dependent transgenic mouse line with optoelectronics after SCI by only targeting vasomotor SPNs. Aim 1. To characterize the transcriptional profile of sympathetic pre-ganglionic neuron subtypes, and to identify those that are responsible for selective regulation of vasomotor tone using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Methods: We will perturb sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons using our orthostatic stimulus (i.e., lower-body negative pressure chamber) in uninjured mice to reveal the subpopulations most activated. For this we will perform snRNA-seq and cell type prioritization using our newly developed tool Augur [4,5]. We will confirm the activation of prioritized populations using retrograde viral tracing as well as multiplexed in-situ hybridization of immediate early genes (e.g., Fos, Arc) and key marker genes. Finally, we will complement this activity-labelled approach by also sequencing trans-synaptically-labeled sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in Chat-IRES- Cre::CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice as an orthogonal approach to identify the transcriptional markers of the sympathetic pre-ganglionic neuron subtypes containing the viral constructs[6]. Aim 2: To understand whether optogenetic stimulation of the hemodynamic hotspot can be harnessed to stabilize blood pressure after SCI. Methods: We will use an optoelectronic system purposefully designed to deeply penetrate the spinal cord. We will test whether optogenetic stimulation of sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons in the hemodynamic hotspot induces pressor responses. Next, to further enhance the precision of this approach we will use intersectional genetics whereby a Cre and FlpO (a discrete recombinase to Cre) dependent virus will be injected into mice harboring Cre expression in ChATON neurons and Flp in the neuronal subtype identified in Aim 2, and the response to optoelectronic stimulation assessed [7]. Finally, we will test whether optogenetic stimulation of either ChATON neurons or vasomotor- specific sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons induces pressor responses that can be controlled in closed loop. SIGNIFICANCE: This project will provide new basic science understanding of the sympathetic nervous system in the context of hemodynamic stability and SCI. Over the long-term this knowledge will help precision medical management of sympathetic dysfunction across pathologies. Findings will be disseminated to the scientific and general groups through impactful publications, conference presentations and media. We will also continue to develop to commercially-viable intellectual property through patents.","Spinal cord injured individuals report unconscious bodily functions such as those of the cardiovascular system (e.g., orthostatic hypotension) as top health issues.

Myren Sohn,,Alexander McGirr,Reducing Suicide Risk with rTMS,"Rationale: One person dies by suicide every 40 seconds (1). Despite decades of research, only two pharmacological interventions have been shown to reduce suicide risk. These are clozapine and lithium, medications that are also associated with many unacceptable adverse events and side effects. To reduce the burden of suicide, non-pharmacological strategies are required. I propose to use non-invasive brain stimulation to decrease suicide risk in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) which is related to 50% of all suicides (2). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established means of treating depression. Although the typical stimulation target is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, evidence suggests that rTMS improves depression via an indirect effect on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; 3). Indeed, the ACC is an important brain region in depression and suicide. Individuals who die by suicide have abnormal neurite (dendrites and axons) structure in the ACC, with less dendritic branching and fewer astrocytes (4-7). This is important because rTMS is associated with thickening of the ACC following treatment, consistent with the normalization of these features (8). Suicide risk assessment relies on an imperfect combination of non-specific risk factors and patient disclosure (9,10). A behavioral task called The Death Implicit Association Test (D-IAT) was developed as an objective measure of suicide risk (9). The D-IAT measures differences in reaction times when categorizing the concepts of life and death with self. Higher D-IAT scores are found in individuals who have previously attempted suicide (9-11). My meta-analytic data further suggests that this test may have clinical utility, as a positive D-IAT score is associated with a four-fold increased risk of suicide attempt over 6 months. The D-IAT can therefore be used as a marker of suicide risk. I will examine how D-IAT scores change with rTMS and whether this is related to the treatment’s effects on the ACC. I will do this with an MRI tool called neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI; 12) that will allow me to non-invasively assess the microstructure (density [NDI] and orientation dispersion [ODI]) of the ACC. Previous work identified abnormal NDI in depression (13) and other psychiatric disorders (14) but no one has used this technique to examine the relationship between D-IAT performance and suicide risk. Objective: My objective is to determine if rTMS can decrease suicide risk by measuring if (1) D-IAT scores and (2) NODDI metrics (NDI and ODI) in the ACC change following rTMS treatment and (3) if D-IAT scores are associated with NODDI metrics in the ACC before and after rTMS treatment. Hypotheses: I hypothesize that (1) D-IAT scores will decrease and (2) NDI will increase following rTMS treatment and (3) there will be a negative correlation between D-IAT scores and NDI. I do not expect to see any changes or correlations in the ODI metric. Methods: Males and females (18-65 years) with a diagnosis of MDD (N=50), of at least moderate severity, will be studied as part of a double-blind, sham-controlled treatment trial. They must maintain stable medication and/or therapy schedules for 4 weeks prior to and throughout this trial. Participants will be excluded if they have a primary diagnosis of any other psychological (i.e., bipolar disorder) or substance use disorder or are actively suicidal. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 4-weeks (20 sessions) of active or sham rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. An rTMS protocol applying intermittent theta-burst stimulation set at 80% of the resting motor-threshold will be used(15). This consists of 5 trains of excitatory stimulation 40 seconds apart: 3 pulses at 50Hz delivered at 5Hz for a total of 600 pulses in 3 minutes and 9 seconds. Participants will undergo a clinical interview assessing current and lifetime MDD severity (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview), suicide histories (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale), and current antidepressant medications. MDD symptoms will be reassessed following treatment. Participants will also complete the D-IAT and an MRI scan at both time points. The NODDI protocol (12) will include three HARDI shells (b=1000,1800,2500) collected on a 3T MRI Scanner. A T1-weighted anatomical image will be used to localize the ACC, defined by the Desikan-Killian-Tourville (DKT) atlas (16). Images will be preprocessed using the diffusion processing pipeline in the FMRIB Software Library. NODDI maps will be derived using the NODDI toolbox in MATLAB (12). Changes in D-IAT scores following rTMS will be measured using a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the treatment group being the effect of interest. Depressive symptoms will be included as a covariate. Two separate two-way ANCOVAs will be conducted to measure changes in NDI and ODI following rTMS treatment. Covariates will include age, the daily dose of antidepressant medication, the number of past suicide attempts, and the current and lifetime severity of MDD. Partial correlations between both NDI and ODI with D-IAT scores at baseline and 4-week timepoints will be conducted, controlling for these same metrics. Significance: If rTMS changes D-IAT scores, we may have found a scalable non-pharmacological means of reducing suicide risk in an enduring fashion. Unlike other treatments that target psychiatric symptoms, this strategy would directly target suicide risk. My work will also clarify how this occurs biologically so that we can further optimize this potential suicide prevention strategy.","Almost 1-million people die by suicide each year. Though current medications and psychotherapies indirectly improve episodic suicidality, many patients continue to suffer from suicidal thoughts and behaviors throughout their lifetime. My study will use a non- invasive brain stimulation treatment combined with an advanced MRI technique to test the therapeutic benefits of non-invasive brain stimulation in decreasing suicide risk. MRI analyses will be used to quantify structural changes in the brain following treatment and changes in suicide risk will be assessed. My findings will advance non-pharmacological options to decrease suicide risk and identify the underlying neurobiological mechanisms to optimize this treatment.",,"Suicide, IAT, rTMS, Risk",Major Depressive Disorder,y,Neuroplasticity,rTMS,Suicide Prevention,Human,"Basic, Translational","Mind and Body, Tech",University of Calgary,2021,22000,13200,,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=nBYxHk4AAAAJJ ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/myren-sohn-879061195/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Myren-Sohn,,University of Calgary,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,2?,,

Ashley Ethier,,David Hodgins,Can Neuroscience inform Addiction Rehabilitation?,"BACKGROUND. The brain regions implicated in substance use (SU) disorders reside along the dopaminergic pathways.1 Dopamine (DA) transmission originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and is released along the projection neurons to the ventral striatum (VS; mesolimbic pathway) or the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway). SU increases DA transmission and inhibits its reuptake. Repeated SU generates a conditioned association between the substance and its effects whilst downregulating dopaminergic response to other incentives.2 Likewise, this DA downregulation reduces self-regulation and impulse control. This diminished control elucidates the psychopharmacological link between SU and crime. SU disorder prevalence rates in Canadian correctional facilities are 70-80%,3 and over half of inmates report committing crimes to finance their SU.4 Drug courts (DC) are an increasingly popular response to the burden of SU on the criminal justice system. Consequently, a $20 million budget was announced to fund five new DCs across Alberta.5 As an incarceration alternative for drug-motivated offenders, DCs integrate SU treatment with judicial supervision through drug testing, treatment compliance monitoring, and escalating sanctions for non-compliance.6 While reduced recidivism7 and SU8 are reported outcomes for graduates, DC graduation rates are low,9,10 thus, emphasizing a need for retention-enhancing approaches. One explanation for high DC attrition is its reliance on punishment rather than positive reinforcement.11 Contingency management (CM) is an evidence- based SU treatment.12 Based on the principles of operant conditioning, CM involves the provision of incentives for positive behavioural change. Thus, CM modifies the reinforcement- consequence association by creating a new association to compete with SU’s reinforcement. Despite its well-documented efficacy, CM is among the least used interventions13 due to a host of negative beliefs (e.g., resembles bribery) and general barriers, most notably CM’s associated cost.14 The CM ‘prize draw’ method mitigates cost-related barriers by utilizing an intermittent reinforcement schedule (50% chance of winning a prize) whilst retaining its efficacy,12 possibly because the anticipation of a &#39;win&#39; activates the VS.15 Though CM has proven effective for improving inmate performance (e.g., chore completion),16 the two studies that evaluated CM’s integration into DCs were unsuccesful,17,18 citing CM protocol deviations (i.e., lack of incentive escalation and immediacy) as significant limitations. Conversely, those with and without a history of offending may differ in their sensitivity to reward and punishment. Gray&#39;s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST19) of personality proposes three neurobiological systems underly individual motivational differences; the behavioural activation system (BAS), behavioural inhibition system (BIS) and the Fight-Flight-and-Freeze system (FFFS). The BAS mediates responses to positively reinforcing stimuli and maps onto the dopaminergic pathways.20 In contrast, the FFFS mediates responses to aversive stimuli.19 The BIS is a motivational conflict resolution system located neurally along the septohippocampal system and the amygdala, inhibiting behaviour in the presence of competing rewards and punishments.21,22 While the RST has explicated personality differences underlying SA23,24 and antisocial behaviour,25 research has yet to investigate the RST&#39;s influence on behavioural change incentivized by CM or CM&#39;s utility with offenders. CURRENT STUDY. The aim of the current study is two-fold. First, as a proof of concept, CM will be implemented into DC programs and evaluated. Second, the influence of the RST systems on CM outcomes for DC clients will be investigated. METHOD. Sixty Alberta DC clients will be recruited. The Motivational Flanker Task (MFT; a modified Eriksen Flanker task26) will be administered to assess the BAS by BIS interaction. Participants will begin with 250 points and be presented with positive, negative, and neutral target words amidst flankers. The MFT will involve two trial types in which the valence of the target and flankers will be either congruent or incongruent. Participants will be instructed to respond to the middle target word with a specific key (e.g., positive target &#39;1&#39; key). Correct responses to positive target words will result in a large gain (50-point &#39;reward&#39;), while incorrect negative responses will result in a large loss (50-point &#39;punishment&#39;). On neutral trials, participants will receive a 5-point gain and 5-point loss for correct and incorrect responses, respectively. Reaction times for positive congruent trials versus neutral baseline trials measure BAS sensitivity, and reaction times on incongruent trials with positive targets and negative flankers measure the BIS. Following the MFT, DC clients will be randomly assigned to either DC as usual (DCAU) or DC plus CM (DC+CM). Abstinence will be assessed twice-weekly through urine testing for 12-weeks.27 Using prize-based CM, DC clients who submit negative urine tests will earn opportunities to draw prize slips. The number of draws earned will increase by one for each consecutive week of abstinence. Though typically done in- person, the technology-based adaptation of a virtual prize draw will be utilized and evaluated; remote CM is considered equally efficacious.28 STATISTICAL ANALYSES. Generalized equation estimating will examine abstinence outcomes over the 12-weeks, with addiction severity29 and criminality18 (e.g., type, history) as covariates. Cox proportional hazards model will compare group retention rates. Hierarchical moderated regression analyses will examine the BIS by BAS interaction on the percentage of days abstinent and days retained. It is hypothesized the BIS will moderate the relationship between BAS activation and treatment outcomes. Specifically, strong BAS in the context of weak BIS will be associated with poorer treatment outcomes, regardless of treatment group. Further, for those in DC+CM, equally elevated BAS (responding to the CM) and BIS (resolving the conflict between SU reinforcement, CM reinforcement, and punishment for DC non- compliance) will predict better treatment outcomes. Lastly, it is hypothesized that the DC+CM group will have greater abstinence and retention rates compared to the DCUA group. SIGNIFICANCE. This study will investigate and improve upon past DC+CM research by adhering to CM&#39;s formalized protocol while addressing several literature gaps. First, it will evaluate DC+CM within the context of Canadian treatment and judicial systems. Second, it will assess the utility of technology-based DC+CM. Lastly, it will investigate the RST on CM outcomes. Clarifying motivational differences underlying CM treatment compliance will inform protocol adaptations (e.g. incentive type, magnitude, frequency) and future implementation efforts, thus improving CM application and outcomes. This study will inform a future randomized control trial to promote and ensure the best care for drug-motivated offenders.","Substance use affects the brain’s natural chemicals.

Clarifying motivational differences underlying CM treatment compliance will inform protocol adaptations (e.g. incentive type, magnitude, frequency) and future implementation efforts, thus improving CM application and outcomes. This study will inform a future randomized control trial to promote and ensure the best care for drug-motivated offenders.","Substance use affects the brain’s natural chemicals.

Moriah Edge-Partington,,Derya Sargin,Early Life Stress and the Gut-Brain Axis: Efficacy of Prebiotic and Probiotic Treatments and Implications for the Serotonin Signalling ,"Rationale. Exposure to early life stress (ELS) during a critical developmental window has detrimental effects on brain function, emotional behaviour, and is a major risk factor for mood disorders later in life (1,2,3). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is particularly crucial for brain development (4). Using an established mouse model of chronic developmental stress, our lab recently discovered that ELS decreases the activity of serotonin neurons and results in long-term anxiety- and depressive-like deficits. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota impact the levels of tryptophan, which is required to produce serotonin in the brain (2,5). Prebiotics and probiotics are substances that can help promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria (6). The proposed study aims to determine the efficacy of pre- and probiotic supplementation during adolescence in mice exposed to chronic ELS in restoring the long-term deficits in brain function and behaviour. We hypothesize that pre- and probiotic supplementation after ELS will lead to an improvement in emotional behaviours and restore the function of the serotonin system. We will test this hypothesis using the following aims: Determine whether prebiotic and probiotic supplementation after ELS will overcome ELS-induced reduction in serotonin activity in the brain (Aim 1) and improve ELS-induced behavioural deficits (Aim 2). ELS alters the function of the GI tract and results in impaired microbiota that can induce persistent changes associated with physical ailments and psychiatric disorders in adulthood (2,4). Recent evidence using rat models of ELS indicates that probiotic administration can improve ELS-induced behavioural deficits (7). Administration of prebiotics was found to be beneficial in treating stress-related, depression-like, and anxiety-like behaviours in mice (8,9). These studies provide strong initial evidence for the efficacy of pre- and probiotic supplementation in improving ELS-induced effects on the gut microbiome and brain. However, research has largely focused on male rodents, the behavioural impacts of the treatment, and is based on a model where the dam is separated from the pups. This research will extend the current literature by examining sex differences and investigate the treatment efficacy on the serotonin system in the brain. It will also use the limited bedding and nesting model (LBN) that is more representative to ELS experienced in humans but has not yet been utilized in gut-brain axis research (3). Methods. Two days after birth, mice will be randomly assigned one of four conditions: control, ELS prebiotic treatment, ELS probiotic treatment, and ELS both treatments. As a model for ELS exposure, the limited bedding and nesting model (LBN) will be used. This is a recently developed and validated stress model of ELS based on exposure of mom and pups to an impoverished bedding and nesting environment during the first postnatal week. This results in reduced maternal care that induces stress in pups and leads to behavioural deficits that persist into adulthood, reminiscent of the effects of ELS in humans (3). The first postnatal week in mice correlates with the peak of the development of the serotonin system, making the brain especially vulnerable to stress. After mice have reached adolescence (~1 month), they will receive their assigned treatment for 3 weeks, which is based on previous studies in rodents showing behavioural and neurochemical effects after this time period (7). Once mice reach adulthood (> 2 months), we will perform elevated plus maze and open field tests to assess anxiety-like behaviours. Depressive-like behaviours will be assessed using the forced swim test and the tail suspension tests. Mice will then be subjected to acute footshock stress which activates serotonin neurons. Following this, mice will be perfused, and brains will be processed for serotonin and cFos, a marker for neuronal activation (10). We will quantify the percentage of cFos- expressing (active) serotonin neurons and compare the differences between ELS, pre-/probiotic treated-ELS, and control mice. We will include a sufficient number of female and male mice in our experiments and incorporate sex as a factor in all analyses. Potential impact. In Canada, 12.1% of youth experience mood and anxiety disorders each year (11). Over 30% of Canadians reported experiencing some form of maltreatment in childhood, including physical and/or sexual abuse (12). Recent evidence indicates that stress among youth and families have skyrocketed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating the search for early interventions for long-term adverse consequences (13). The proposed work will increase our understanding of the efficacy of an alternative treatment approach for youth exposed to early adversity. It will provide new knowledge aimed at the discovery of diet supplements in improving long-term ELS-induced deficits in brain function and emotional behaviour.
","Within the scientific community, there has been mounting interest in how our gut microbiota (microorganisms within the gut) can impact the onset of psychological disorders, particularly depression and anxiety. Our gut microbiota can be negatively influenced by a variety of factors including medications, diet, and exposure to stress. This study aims to investigate the effects of stress during early life on gut and brain health in an early life stress mouse model that develops anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours. Additionally, the effectiveness of nutritional treatments in reversing the negative psychological and physical impacts of early life stress will be assessed.",,"Early Life Stress (ELS), Mice, Seritonin, Stress, Probiotic","""Stress, Anxiety, Depression""",n,Gut-Brain Axis,Pre-biotic,Nutrition,Animal,Basic,Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2021,7000,4200,,,,,,,"4,200.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/moriah-edge-partington-b77b56132/,,,,Therapy Collective,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Noam Sander,,Fred (Frederick) Colbourne,"Plant-based recovery after stroke: the effect of colchicine, on functional outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a stroke subtype that accounts for 15% of strokes but has a devastating mortality rate (50%); most survivors are left with severe impairments (1). ICH is characterized by bleeding in the brain, often caused by the rupturing of a blood vessel, and unfortunately there are no neuroprotective interventions for ICH that can save brain cells from damage (2). As recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory responses worsen ICH-induced injury, there has been interest in the use of neuroprotective anti-inflammatory therapies for ICH (3). Colchicine is a plant hormone derived from colchicum plants that is known to reduce stroke risk, and evidence shows that it has anti-inflammatory properties (4,5). To date, no research has investigated colchicine in ICH; thus we aim to thoroughly investigate the potential of colchicine as a neuroprotective therapy and will conduct the first animal ICH study using this agent. We hypothesize that colchicine will reduce inflammation and improve functional outcomes in ICH. This project will consist of two different experiments. In both experiments, statistical power calculations will be used to ensure sufficient group sizes. Before proceeding, a pilot study will be conducted to determine a safe dosage of colchicine in adult male rats. We have carefully considered dosing, and concluded that 0.05 mg/kg of colchicine daily will be safe and effective. This dose is calculated to be equivalent to the common clinical dose (0.5mg/60kg), and is within the range used in other preclinical studies (0.02mg/kg-0.75mg/kg) (6,7,8). Experiment 1 will determine whether colchicine reduces inflammation or affects bleeding (safety concern). We hypothesize that colchicine will confer benefit by reducing inflammation and cell death without affecting overall bleeding. This experiment will consist of three groups: a control group, an experimental group given colchicine before and after ICH (pre-ICH group), and another experimental group given colchicine only after ICH (post-ICH group). As millions are currently prescribed colchicine, we will include the pre-ICH group to model this patient population. We expect to see reduced inflammation and cell death in both experimental groups, even more so in the pre-ICH group because anti-inflammatory effects will be present before injury. ICH will be induced in all groups using bacterial collagenase, which ruptures blood vessels in the brain, causing bleeding (9). Animals will be euthanized 48 hours post-ICH for brains to be histologically analyzed; maximal inflammation occurs around this time so effects will be most evident (10). We will assess: hematoma volume using cresyl violet, cell death in the area around the injury using cell count, and inflammation using Perls Prussian Blue (indicating iron presence in cells, measuring macrophage/microglia activity). This methodology is ethically advantageous as we can assess several endpoints simultaneously and therefore use fewer rats. By comparing the three groups, we will determine if colchicine has a significant impact on bleeding in the brain, inflammatory activity, and cell death all within the same experiment. The primary goal of experiment 2 is to test whether colchicine has an effect on functional outcome and brain injury post-ICH. These results are the most valuable to clinicians and therefore we have selected the most translationally relevant endpoints (11). We hypothesize that the reduction in inflammation and cell death generated by colchicine will result in an improved functional outcome and reduced total injury. This experiment will include a control group and a group given colchicine post-ICH. Multiple functional assessments (neurological deficit score and walking ability) will provide a rigorous composite behavioural score of functional outcome (12). After 14 days, the animals will be euthanized and brains will be sectioned to assess injury size. This study began as a collaboration with clinicians who want to investigate using the plant hormone, colchicine, as a neuroprotective therapy. As our lab has a history of high-quality translational research that aligns with the standards and recommendations for the field (11), we will provide necessary data to guide a clinical trial evaluating the impact of colchicine in ICH patients. Dosing, endpoints, and translational issues have been collaboratively determined to maximize the value of our findings and lead to effective translation (13). This study will have direct implications on colchicine as a treatment for ICH and will inform future studies on using colchicine to improve outcome. On the other hand, if we find colchicine to have adverse effects in treating ICH our findings may advise researchers and clinicians of the potential risks of giving colchicine after ICH, and therefore both outcomes will make for a useful and interesting publication.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a bleed in the brain, is a deadly stroke subtype with no clinically-approved therapies to reduce brain injury. The bleed leads to inflammation in the brain: a key injury pathway that contributes to worsened outcomes. Our study will be the first in ICH research to use colchicine, an anti- inflammatory plant hormone, to investigate if reducing inflammation post-ICH will improve functional outcomes. Significantly, this well-considered initial study will rigorously assess the safety and efficacy of colchicine in ICH to inform clinicians and directly guide a planned clinical trial on colchicine.",,"ICH, Colchicine, Inflmmation, Injury, Cell",Stroke,n,Inflammation,"Colchicine, Hormone",Nutrition,Animal,Basic,Nutraceutical,University of Alberta,2021,7000,4200,,,,,,,"4,200.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=eZGDAQcAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamsander/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Noam-H-Sander-2233378673,,,Government of Alberta,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eden Redman ,,Jacqueline Cummine,Learning a new Language with the help of a Brain-Computer Interface,"This application focuses on a NeurAlbertaTech project, a novel BCI-optimized language acquisition platform, predicated on the subsequent memory effect (SME) or the phenomenon that successful and unsuccessful memory encoding can be differentiated based on brain activity during study. Our platform will utilize a deep learning model to predict the SME with respect to the encoding of a given cross-language word association, and alert users in real-time whether this association was likely to be successful or not. Much of the literature on predicting the SME has focused on EEG data. For example, Hohne et al. (2016) successfully predicted subsequent memory based on hippocampal EEG recordings (accuracy = 65%), Noh et al. (2018) achieved similar accuracy when analyzing cortical EEG data, and Arora et al. (2018) achieved nearly 75% accuracy when using deep models. While contemporary research suggests that successful and unsuccessful memory encoding events can be dissociated to a moderate degree, we aim to develop a streamlined and accessible platform that focuses on language acquisition. To maximize impact, our team has several user-oriented goals integrated into our project development timeline. Our tool will be brought to life through gamification, whereby users can learn a language in an enjoyable and engaging fashion. As per the interdisciplinary mandate of NeurAlbertaTech, the development team working on this project will include a number of designers and business students in order to refine our prototype through user-oriented design, beta testing, and market research.The platform focuses on learning Mandarin, however we are developing the architecture of the program so that it can be readily tweaked to address the problems faced by an even greater population, such as those facing day-to-day struggles related to speech language pathology. We will attain formal ethics approval for our study and subsequent publications through partnering with an existing academic human neuroscience laboratory at the University of Alberta. Through this partnership we will also have access to the lab’s volunteer pool and a facility in which there is a standardized experimental environment in order to minimize external variances. Using an OpenBCI 16-channel system we will be validating a trial-by-trial EEG neurofeedback protocol to gauge language acquisition across multiple sessions. We will have both a sham condition in which participants are given random feedback, and an experimental condition in which we provide neurofeedback as provided by the output of a ML algorithm, derived from a user’s baseline. Each session would have the participants complete a new baseline and generate a new ML alogrithm. We will compare learning in several dimensions, namely the number of words reliably learned after each session and event related potentials (ERPs). The researchers with direct participant contact and the participants themselves will be blinded to the condition in which each participant is assigned to. Judging by the effect size cited in previous papers (Hohne et al. 2016, Noh et al. 2018, Arora et al. 2018) we will require 20 participants, with each attending 3 learning sessions, with half of the participants assigned to a sham condition. Training would be available to the sham condition participants after the experiment, due to the open access nature of the platform. At the culmination of this project, we will have an scientifically validated and open-source web-based BCI tool for language acquisition. We expect our program to garner significant media attention, given the broad coverage of our previous projects facilitated by NeurAlbertaTech as well as our growing social reach. Due to the translational nature across academia and industry spaces, we will be able to elicit intrigue from a wide variety of interest groups. This will be accomplished by actively reaching out both within the university community as well as broadly across Alberta, with the help of our provincial partner Campus Alberta Neuroscience. The prospects of commercialization and widespread adaptation are high, as NeurAlbertaTech is connected to a number of entrepreneurial incubators and has previous experience bringing translational neuroscience research programs to market. As a researcher I have a comprehensive body of project management experience, including managing a Department of Psychology cognitive neuroscience laboratory at the University of Alberta and leading neurotech development project teams (RemBRAINdt, Koalacademy). Additionally, I have co-authored publications in peer-reviewed neuroscience journals such as Methods in Neuroscience and Psychophysiology. This project is a collaboration between NeurAlbertaTech and Dr. Jacqueline Cummine, a Neuroscience in Literacy Canada Research Chair Tier II. Dr. Cummine has an extensive background studying linguistics within a neuroscience framework utilizing a variety of neuroimaging modalities. She will provide expert guidance on experimental design, imaging protocols, and data analysis.","We are developing the first language learning platform optimized to use brain waves!

Emma Morelli ,,John Howland,Impact of Pre-natal Cannabis use on Brain Development,"Due to the recent legalization of cannabis, there is an increasing need to understand its effects in a variety of populations, particularly in pregnant women (Fried and Smith, 2001; Richardson et al. 2016). In fact, some women believe that use of cannabis as relief for morning sickness is harmless. Furthermore, women may be using cannabis before they are even aware that they are pregnant. Use during this stage is especially problematic as the initial stages of pregnancy are the most important for organogenesis, thus this may be the most detrimental to fetal development (Alpar et al. 2016). Thus, increasing our knowledge of the effects of cannabis use in pregnancy is required to educate the public on the consequences of its use. Smoking cannabis is the most common method of administration in the general population; however, current preclinical studies have mainly focused on intraperitoneal or vapour treatment with THC or other cannabinoid receptor agonists (Scheyer et al. 2020; Weimar et al. 2020). Furthermore, the use of a cannabis strain that is commonly available in stores would allow any results obtained to be more relatable to humans as these strains are readily available to everyone. Given this brief background, my project aims to assess the effects of exposure to cannabis smoke during pregnancy on the long-term cognitive functions of rat offspring. Use of rats will allow controlled delivery of cannabis and the ability to assess their brains for changes after behavioural testing. The Howland laboratory has recently developed a protocol for delivering cannabis smoke to rats using a commercially available system (Roebuck et al. 2020b). We will use this system to expose timed pregnant rats to the smoke of 200 mg of commercially available high THC (Mohawk strain; 20% THC, <1% CBD; Aphria Canada) or low THC cannabis (Treasure Island strain; <1%THC, 13% CBD; Aphria Canada). Rats will be bred in our facility, and exposure will occur once daily from gestational day 6-20, which roughly corresponds to parts of the first and second trimester in humans. The rats will deliver their pups naturally and the offspring will be allowed to grow up until young adulthood (2 months of age). We will then test the male and female offspring for discrimination learning and behavioural flexibility using well established procedures in the Howland laboratory (Bryce et al. 2015; Roebuck et al. 2020a). A total of 48 rats will be tested (24 of each treatment group from different litters, split evenly into males and females). We will use automated, touchscreen-equipped operant conditioning chambers for the tasks as they allow for accurate measurement of cognition, while reducing experimental error and stress associated with manual delivered tasks (Mar et al. 2013). We will use two tasks to measure discrimination learning and behavioural flexibility: pairwise discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (RL), respectively. These tasks will be conducted within a sound attenuating operant conditioning chamber. A masked touchscreen surface and opposing reward delivery system are used to quantify and motivate behaviour. In the case of PD/RL, a custom mask exposes two rectangular regions of the touchscreen that will display distinct images during testing. After habituation to the chambers, the rats are required to consistently pick one of the images to receive food reward in the PD task. Once they reach a stable criterion of performance, the rewarded stimulus is switched, and the number of testing sessions it takes for the rat to learn the new rule (i.e., RL) is taken as a measure of behavioural flexibility. I expect that the rats exposed to high-THC containing cannabis while in utero will display slower RL than controls, as this type of cognition depends on the prefrontal cortex. Following the behavioural experiment, the brains of the offspring will be analyzed for levels of cannabinoid receptors in Dr. Laprairie’s laboratory. Taken together, our findings will have implications for the effects of cannabis smoke exposure on the offspring. These data will help inform public health measures related to the legalization of cannabis in Canada.","This proposal summarizes an experiment designed to assess the potential long-term behavioural effects of cannabis smoke exposure during pregnancy on rat offspring. Our experiment will assess whether two forms of cognition, discrimination learning and behavioural flexibility, are altered by smoke exposure while in utero. Our findings will have implications for human health, in populations where exposure to cannabis smoke occurs early in development.",,"Cannabis, Rats, Offspring, Behavioural, Smoke",n/a,n,Brain Development,Cannabis,"Pregnancy, Geriatric Development",Animal,Basic,Nutraceutical,University of Saskatchewan,2021,7000,4200,,,,,,,"4,200.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regan Wright,,Kelvin Jones,Tipi-to-the-Bench: Reconciling how Indigenous Healing Practices Support Recovery from Trauma,"BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: People across different cultures recognize the benefits of rocking and swinging babies to help them grow quiet and fall asleep. The Nehiyaw (Cree) people also used a hammock-like swing as part of their traditional parenting practice to lull little ones to sleep and nurture these gifts from Creator (Auger, 2017). Following colonial contact, traditional parenting was supplanted by assimilation practices and laws. Institutionalization of generations of Aboriginal people in Canada deprived them of wholesome parenting and healing, contributing to the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities especially in the areas of mental health and chronic disease (TRCC-V1, 2015). Nearly twenty years ago Darlene Auger was gifted with a vision that the people needed to be swung, not just the little ones but also those for whom the history and legacy of colonial institutionalization had left scars that required healing. Thus began the recent history of Wîwîp’son - the healing swing (Auger, 2017). Can a Western science approach provide support to the traditional practice and belief that Wîwîp’son brings healing? The use of interventional motion therapy has a long-history but until recently there were few physiological measurements done to provide mechanistic hypotheses (Grabherr et al. 2015). Recently, the field of non-pharmacological sleep therapeutics has provided evidence that the sensors in the inner ear responsible for balance, detect swinging motion and cause specific patterns of brain waves associated with improved sleep architecture and beneficial effects on memory (Bayer et al. 2011; Perrault et al. 2019). None of these previous studies have combined measures of brain waves with other physiological rhythms that are indicative of stress levels, like heart rate variability and breathing (DeBeck et al., 2010). AIM: To determine if a characteristic pattern of physiological rhythms emerges during Wîwîp’son. HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that participants experiencing swing therapy, compared to stationary control, will experience: i) increased slow oscillations and sleep spindle frequency, ii) entrainment of cardiorespiratory rhythms consistent with diminished acute stress, and iii) that the strength of these physiological outcomes will be associated with the self- reported perceptibility of healing and lucidity of dreams or visions during a session. METHODS: Two sample populations will participate in 60-minute Wîwîp’son sessions in two experiments. All sessions will take place in the environment chosen by the Indigenous healer participating in these studies. A priori sample sizes have been determined based on prior sleep EEG studies using effect sizes for spindle density and slow oscillation outcome measures. The first experiment will use a convenience sample of twenty healthy adult volunteers (balanced for self-reported genders) that will be screened for good sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Buysse et al., 1989) and must be naive to Wîwîp’son. Participants will come for two mid-afternoon sessions (temperature and auditory stimulation controlled): one with the swing stationary, and one with the swing in motion (condition order randomized). In the second observational study, 12 adults who are seeking therapeutic swing therapy will be invited to participate while wearing physiological monitors. These individuals will not have a control session in which swinging is withheld (for ethical reasons). The outcome measures in group 1 will be compared between conditions and the outcome measures in group 2 will be compared for similarity to group 1 swing condition. Five minutes of baseline values for all biometrics will be acquired prior to the formal therapeutic session. All participants will have three days of habituation (in their homes) to the biometric sensors prior to the first session to mitigate Hawthorne effects. The biometric sensors are unobtrusive wearable devices for measuring EEG (Muse-S) , breathing and heart rate (Hexoskin Smart Garment) that have been used in recent studies (Peers et al., in review; Wilkinson et al., 2020). All devices can be appropriately cleaned between users. Data are transmitted by Bluetooth and stored for time and frequency domain analysis in MATLAB (e.g. Caplan et al., 2001). Sleep architecture will be quantified by sleep stage analysis visually inspected by experienced neurophysiologists. Demographics, participant expectancy and self-reported dreams/memories will be collected using a combination of questionnaires, inventories and semi-structured interviews (Auger, 2017). Visual analogue scales following a session will be used to measure alertness, perceptions of healing and lucidity of dreams to stratify data for moderation analysis. These studies will provide the first characterization of how Wîwîp’son therapy modulates physiological rhythms and how those changes may be associated with healing. We acknowledge that the healing potential of swing therapy may only partially reveal itself in these measures. Longitudinal studies with additional biomarkers of chronic stress and immune system status may be warranted after these initial investigations. Nevertheless, there is clear value in pursuit of these kinds of projects at this time in Canadian history.","The gentle sway of a hammock, the rocking of a baby, this motion is known to the Nehiyaw people to heal and soothe. Wîwîp’son, or the healing swing is performed today by Indigenous knowledge keepers to facilitate healing through motion therapy. Combining this traditional knowledge with a western scientific approach, we will examine the effects of the swing motion on a person’s heart rate, breathing and their brain wave patterns using wearable biometric sensors. The goal is to see what patterns and rhythm changes emerge in these biological measures while the person experiences the healing swing.",,"Sleep, Healing, Swing, Physiological",n/a,y,Sleep,"Motion Therapy, Indigenous Ceremony",Trauma Recovery,Human,"Basic, Translational",Mind and Body,University of Alberta,2021,7000,4200,,,,,,,"4,200.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winnie Pan,,Kendra Furber,Can Diet Re-Myelinate? The role of dietary fats on oligodendrocyte survival ,"Background and Rationale: Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) which produce the myelin sheath, a fatty insulating layer that wraps around neuronal axons to facilitate signal transduction. Myelin damage is a characteristic of traumatic brain injuries and neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS involves an autoimmune attack on the myelin sheath, which interferes with the efficient transmission of nerve impulses, leading to cognitive and functional motor impairments. Canada has one of the highest incidences of MS in the world, with an estimate of 90,000 affected individuals, leading to physical, emotional, and financial burdens [1]. Other white matter injuries of the CNS can also be addressed by studying the mechanisms of myelination [2]. My research focuses on examining the effects of dietary nutrients on oligodendrocytes and myelination in the CNS. Oxidative stress is associated with the inflammatory pathogenesis of MS [3], and other white matter injuries [2]. Excessive oxidative species impede metabolic processes of neural cells, leading to axonal and myelin damage. Anti-oxidants appear to have neuroprotective effects by reducing inflammation and mitigating demyelination. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) act as important regulators in the brain for cell structure and function. Omega-6 PUFAs, such as linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), are precursors for prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes which are involved in pro-inflammatory signaling cascades [4, 5]. Omega-3 PUFAs, such as alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties [4]. Thus, it has been suggested that a balance between the dietary intake between Omega-6 and Omega-3 is important for healthy brain function [6]. The overall objective of my research is to determine the impacts of how various omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs on myelination in the CNS. Previous studies have demonstrated that Omega-3 supplementations have neuroprotective effects on various animal models with neuroinflammation, such as cuprizone-induced demyelination and autoimmune encephalomyelitis models [7]. However, the direct effect of omega-3 PUFAs on myelination remains unclear due to the complexity of CNS tissues. An in vitro study in cell culture will allow for more direct observation of the potential effects of PUFAs on oligodendrocytes. My hypothesis is that Omega-3 fatty acids (ie. DHA, EPA, ALA) will promote oligodendrocyte survival, proliferation, and differentiation compared to Omega-6 fatty acids. Methods: I will use a CG4 cell line and primary cell culture to study the effects of different PUFA on oligodendrocytes in vitro [8]. Cells maintained in defined growth media show high rates of proliferation, whereas the removal of growth factors and addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) will induce differentiation over the course of several days in vitro (DIV 0 to DIV 6). Cells will be supplement with DHA, EPA, ALA, ARA, and LA using de-lipidated FBS at concentrations of 10-200 μM [9]; supplementation of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids will be used as controls. The uptake of fatty acids will be monitored using gas-chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to determine changes in cellular levels [10]. For survival assays, immature progenitor cells (DIV 0) and mature differentiation cells (DIV 6) will be supplemented prior to acute neurotoxic insults to induce oxidative stress (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) or excitotoxicity (e.g. glutamate). Cytotoxicity (n=6 for each PUFA) will be determined using assay kits for cell apoptosis/necrosis, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress (Cayman Chemical). For proliferation and differentiation assays, immunocytochemistry (n=6 for each PUFA) will be performed against well- established cell-specific markers of different developmental stages to determine the percentage of A2B5+ (or PDGFRα+), GalC+, and MBP+ cells at daily intervals (DIV 0-6) [8]. Myelin gene expression (n=6 for each PUFA) will be quantified at the mRNA and protein level by qPCR and western blot, respectively [8]. I will also investigate expression levels of key genes involved in lipid metabolism by qPCR, including members of the as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and epoxygenase (EPOX) pathways. Potential Impacts: Myelin has a high-fat content, comprised of ~70% lipids, yet the impact of dietary fatty acids on myelination in the CNS is still unclear. This project will allow me to address the fundamental questions about the role of these essential nutrients at the cellular level. Understanding the molecular function of PUFAs in oligodendrocytes will better inform experiments in animal models of white matter injury and disease. This will allow for insights regarding the potential of dietary interventions to help mitigate the extent of myelin damage or promote myelin repair in neurological disorders.","Myelin is a fatty insulator that wraps around neuronal processes facilitating signal transduction. Cells called oligodendrocytes produce myelin in the central nervous system. Although myelin is fatty, there is little known about the impact of dietary fat on oligodendrocyte function.

Matthew Heffernan,,Kristin Musselman,An Electrically Stimulated Step in the right Direction for Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Rationale Falling is a critical issue for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury/disease (iSCI/D), whose balance control is impaired due to partial paralysis of the trunk and limbs. [1] As a result of this impairment, approximately 78% of people with iSCI/D fall at least once per year. [1] Prevention of falls requires intact reactive balance responses, such as taking a reactive step. [2] These steps can reposition an individual’s centre of mass (CoM) within their base of support following an unexpected perturbation. Falls can occur when an initial reactive step does not adequately reposition the CoM. Many individuals living with SCI/D cannot produce effective reactive steps, resulting in a high risk of falls and fall-related injuries. [3] A potential solution to the critical issue of falls for the iSCI/D population is the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to facilitate a step when balance is lost. FES is applied through surface electrodes positioned over a skeletal muscle belly or a peripheral nerve to generate muscle contractions for the purposes of rehabilitation. [4] Applying FES to the common fibular nerve elicits a flexor withdraw response in individuals with upper motor neuron lesions, such as SCI, causing flexion at the hip and knee and dorsiflexion at the ankle. This FES application improves gait parameters, such as step length and foot clearance [5] and increases corticospinal tract excitability in individuals with iSCI/D [5] which may result in a reduced threshold and reaction time for reactive stepping responses. Hypothesis The aim of my project is to investigate the effectiveness of FES at improving the immediate and long-term reactive stepping ability of individuals with motor incomplete SCI/D. Hypothesis 1: The application of FES during a lab-based assessment of reactive stepping, the lean- and-release test [6], will result in an immediate improvement in the behavioral, temporal and spatial characteristics of reactive stepping after SCI/D. Hypothesis 2: Individuals who receive reactive balance training combined with FES (RBT+FES) will show greater improvements in balance control and fewer falls in daily life than those who receive RBT without FES. Methods To test Hypothesis 1, 15 individuals with iSCI/D who demonstrate impaired reactive stepping ability will participate in one lab-based assessment. The lean-and- release test, which simulates a forward fall in standing, will be used repeatedly to elicit reactive steps. Participants will don a safety harness and stand with their feet on adjacent force plates. Two additional force plates will be placed in front of the participants. Participants will then lean forward until 8-12% of their body weight is supported by a horizontal cable attached to the safety harness at waist level. A force transducer will be attached to the cable and release mechanism, providing feedback on the percentage of body weight support in real time. The cable will be manually released by a researcher at an unpredictable time during each 30- second trial. In approximately half of the trials, FES to the common fibular nerve will be applied. The stimulation will be triggered synchronously with cable release. Force plate and kinematic data will be collected. Behavioral (i.e. number of reactive steps taken), temporal (i.e. time from perturbation to initiation of reactive step) and spatial (i.e. length and width of reactive step) characteristics will be measured. Performance with and without FES will be compared. To test Hypothesis 2, I will complete a pilot randomized clinical trial with 22 individuals with iSCI/D. Participants will be randomly allocated to RBT+FES or to RBT alone. They will complete 18 one-hour training sessions over six weeks under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist. During each training session, participants will don a safety harness that is secured to an overhead track that permits movement in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions over a distance of 2m x 4m. Participants in both groups will practice personalized standing and walking tasks that challenge their balance while also experiencing perturbations (i.e. manual pushes and pulls applied at waist level by the therapist) at a frequency of about once per training minute. [7] Participants in the RBT+FES group will also receive FES to the common fibular nerve bilaterally, such that every time they attempt to initiate a reactive step, the stimulation will assist. The stimulation will be triggered by pressure sensors placed in the participants’ shoes. Clinical assessments and the lean-and- release test will be completed before training, immediately after training and six months post- training. The clinical assessment will be completed by a therapist blind to group allocation and will include the Berg Balance Scale, mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and evaluations of lower limb strength and proprioception. Falls will be monitored for six months after training through an online survey and regular phone calls. Performance on the clinical measures and the lean and release test, and the occurrence of falls will be compared between groups. Potential Impact The use of FES to improve reactive stepping ability is a novel and unconventional approach. In our lab we have completed pilot testing with two individuals with iSCI/D and demonstrated that RBT+FES improved reactive stepping ability. [8] Therefore, the results of this study could guide the development of new balance training protocols. Improving reactive balance control in individuals with iSCI/D would translate into fewer falls and fall-related injuries. This would help to significantly improve health outcomes for these individuals and decrease health care costs associated with iSCI/D. Reactive stepping ability has also been linked to increased incidence of falls in older adults and individuals with stroke. [9,10] If we can demonstrate FES to be an effective training technique for improving reactive balance and reducing falls for individuals with iSCI, researchers might become increasingly interested in using FES for the rehabilitation of reactive balance for older adults and individuals with stroke.","Imagine you are walking and stumble over a bump.

Eva Simoncicova ,,Marie-Ève Tremblay,"Dieting to combat Dementia, Ketogenic style","The propensity of human nature to constantly evolve has tremendously transformed our society, ultimately leading to a progressive aging of world’s population. As ~25% of projected global population is to be > 65 years old by 2050, the necessity to develop strategies targeting aging-associated alterations storms into the foreground[1]. Cognitive decline represents the major feature of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Altered immune system and chronic neuroinflammation were previously associated with loss of synaptic plasticity within neuronal networks and neurodegeneration, two prominent correlates of cognitive deficits[2-4]. The central role of microglia, brain resident macrophages, in this process is undeniable, considering microglia initiate immune responses, and participate in refinement of synapses and clearance of extracellular debris[5,6]. Aging impacts microglia by promoting a shift towards less neurohomeostatic, yet more proinflammatory phenotypes, which can be damaging for proper maintenance of neurons and synapses[4,7-12]. Aging-induced vulnerability of microglia also affects their ability to optimally respond to challenges (e.g. trauma, pathogens, stress)[4,7,10,13]. Infectious pathogen (bacterial, viral, fungal)-induced conditions are counted between primary causes of morbidity in seniors. Moreover, diagnosis of infection was indicated to increase rates and severity of cognitive decline and probability of dementia onset[14-16]. Recently, topic of microorganisms in the pathogenesis of sporadic neurodegenerative diseases (accounting for majority of the cases) has been re-opened, e.g. in context of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and herpesviruses[17-19]. Aging is hypothesized to detrimentally impact intrinsic microglial energetic metabolism by promoting switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) towards abnormal glycolysis[20-23]. The resulting inability to properly meet the demands of sustained highly energetic activities, could lead to microglial senescence via lowered mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, and impairment of self-maintaining autophagy[11,12,21-23]. Providing an alternative source of energy via diet may give microglia the means to perform their critically beneficial physiological functions[23-26]. Ketogenic diet (KD), primarily consisting of > 70 – 80% fatty acids and < 10 % carbohydrates, is used in clinical treatment of epilepsy, cancer and obesity[27]. It mimics fasting, inducing reprogramming of cells towards utilization of fats as primary energetic source. Ketones can bypass the cytoplasmic glycolysis and support the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and OXPHOS[26,27]. One of the main objectives of my project is to further elucidate the microglial state in aging. Loss of microglial neuroprotective character is expected to result in an inappropriate maintenance of brain parenchyma, dysregulated refinement of synaptic features, synaptic loss, and cognitive decline in aging. Exposure to a viral infection-induced inflammation may exacerbate the severity of these events and stimulate appearance of AD hallmarks e.g. accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-beta plaques or formation of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. These alterations are to be reflected in worsened performance in cognitive and social interaction tasks compared to aged-matched controls. We further hypothesize that by acting as alternative energetic source, ketones will provide support to microglial OXPHOS and metabolism. In this manner, targeting microglia via a dietary treatment could prevent and/or alleviate the impact of aging on these cells, preserving their ability to sufficiently cope with increased requirements of aged organism and viral challenge without a damaging effect on synaptic plasticity. In my project, I aim to explore microglial alterations upon exposure to a viral infection-mirroring condition in a model of aged (18-months old) C57BL/6J mice of both sexes. I will focus on impact of a single injection of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a frequently utilized viral mimetic agent[13,28,29], in both short- (2 – 3 weeks post) and long-term (3 – 4 months post). Hippocampus is the target brain region as it is crucial for activity-dependent learning and memory formation, aspects negatively impacted in aging and neurodegenerative conditions. The analysis of microglial structural and ultrastructural properties, and their interactions with synapses will be performed by combination of immuno-histochemical and -fluorescent techniques with confocal and state-of-art electron microscopy imaging. Microglial populations were shown to be highly heterogeneous, and in this context, we will also explore the dark microglia, a subtype previously discovered by our lab in experimental animal models of aging, chronic stress, or AD30. Presence of AD-related hallmarks such as fibrillar amyloid-beta plaques will be assessed with the help of confocal and electron microscopy. Furthermore, microglial metabolic profile and functional single-cell proteome will be characterized by mass spectrometry-based techniques (e.g. CYTOF). To determine changes in hippocampus-associated behaviours e.g. anxiety-like behaviour, contextual and spatial memory or cognitive flexibility, as well as social interaction, experimental animals will be exposed to a battery of tasks including open field test, novel/spatial object recognition tests, Barnes maze and three- chamber social interaction test. To determine the impact of diet on microglial features in viral-like conditions, experimental mice will be administered ketogenic diet for a duration of 1.5 month prior to the poly(I:C) injection and until the end of the experiment. Parallelly, markers of inflammation, aging and ketosis will be assessed from blood samples taken throughout the experiment (before initiation of the diet; acute post-injection phase; at sacrifice). To achieve statistical significance, for analysis of microglia, we will use minimum of 6 animals/group for all techniques, while for behavioural assessment and molecular analysis sample size will be at least 12 animals/group. Technical limitation, we aim to mitigate by increased sample size, is an elevated animal morbidity rate with aging (15-20 %). Statistical comparisons will be made in Prism using a Student’s test (for 2 groups meeting the normal distribution criteria), Mann-Whitney U-test (for 2 groups not meeting the normal distribution criteria), or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction or Tukey’s test (for groups across variables, with multiple comparisons). To summarize, project proposes to study microglial alterations via combination of various methods in viral infection-like condition and their involvement in loss of synaptic plasticity, cognitive decline, and neurodegeneration in aging mouse model. In line with the NeuroCAM mandate, by utilizing alternative treatments (ketogenic diet) or via identification of specific microglial features and pathways with potential for development of targeted therapeutical strategies, we hope to help bridge the gap between the basic and clinical neurological research.","Recent events highlighted the frailty and vulnerability of aged individuals to viral agents.

Patrick Gurges,,Mark Boulos,Could Cannabis Smoke clear the Throat of Sleep Apnea?,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and chronic disease affecting approximately 13% of men and 6% of women globally (1). OSA is characterized by periods of airway closure during sleep due to a decrease in pharyngeal muscle tone, leading to intermittent periods of hypoxia and arousal from sleep (2). As a result, patients with OSA experience daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, decreased cognition, and depression (3–6). Additionally, intermittent apneas lead to increased sympathetic activation during sleep (7,8), which can contribute to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, among other conditions (9,10). Currently, the gold standard for OSA therapy is the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which acts as a pneumatic splint and prevents oropharyngeal collapse (11). CPAP therapy has been shown to have positive effects on cognition, mood, blood pressure, and overall cardiovascular health (12,13). However, the success in clinical patient outcomes is shadowed by the generally low rates of patient adherence to therapy; adherence rates are typically between 30-60% due to the inherent costs and inconveniences associated with therapy (14–16). As of yet, no pharmacological therapies have been formally approved for clinical use in OSA. Cannabinoids (i.e. cannabis, cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) are a class of drug which work on the CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors. Dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, has been shown to improve ventilatory stability and reduce apneic events in rodent models (17,18). Clinically, emerging evidence suggests that dronabinol can reduce OSA severity (19) and increase the quantity of slow-wave sleep (SWS) in patients with OSA (20). However, data supporting these associations are limited to only two studies with small samples sizes, and only examine one form of synthetic THC. Therefore, the effect of cannabis on sleep architecture and OSA severity in patients with OSA remains inconclusive. We have collected a detailed set of medication and substance use, demographic, clinical, physiological, and polysomnographic data from over 8,000 adults who underwent overnight sleep studies at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Sleep Laboratory from 2010 till present. Our aim is to determine whether cannabis use, in one or more of its many forms, is associated with changes in OSA severity and sleep outcomes. We hypothesize that cannabinoid use is associated with a decrease in OSA severity and an improvement in clinical sleep parameters. To this end, we will retrospectively examine associations between use of products containing cannabinoids (i.e. cannabis, marijuana, cannabidiol) in any form (i.e. oil, smoke, edibles) and OSA severity, as measured by the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and respiratory distress index (RDI). Furthermore, the association between cannabinoids and clinical sleep parameters, such as percentage of time spent in each sleep stage (N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement [REM]), sleep efficiency (proportion of total time in bed spent asleep), wake after sleep onset (length of periods of wakefulness occurring after sleep onset), sleep onset latency (time from full wakefulness to sleep onset), REM latency (time from sleep onset to REM onset), and total sleep time will be assessed. Analyses will be performed using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for factors known to affect both OSA and sleep quality, such as age, sex, and body mass index. We will also run exploratory analyses that will examine the potential impact of specific cannabinoid formulations and/or doses on OSA severity and our clinical sleep parameters of interest.","Sleep apnea is a common and serious disorder where the airway closes during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep and drops in oxygen levels at night. This disorder has been associated with negative effects on mood and cognition, and increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Unfortunately, there are no approved medicinal therapies for sleep apnea. We want to explore the effects of cannabinoids (cannabis, marijuana, cannabinoid oil) on breathing during sleep and overall sleep quality using data from overnight sleep studies.

Although Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) remains as the gold-standard treatment for OSA, its benefits are the most pronounced in severe, as opposed to mild-moderate OSA. More importantly, CPAP’s efficacy is offset by poor adherence; one study reported only 30% compliance after 3 months, which was chiefly attributed to interface difficulties, claustrophobia, and intrusiveness (8,9). Moreover, CPAP is aerosol- generating, making it an unfavourable modality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other OSA treatments such as weight loss, bariatric surgery and mandibular advancement devices are either invasive, expensive or require long-term patient motivation. As a result, there is an emerging trend in the literature and clinical practice that calls for alternative treatments for patients who are non-compliant to CPAP or experience mild-moderate OSA that is amenable to less invasive management. OSA is primarily induced by decreased upper airway and hypopharyngeal muscle tone during sleep. Several studies have suggested that oropharyngeal exercises (OPEs) derived from speech-language pathology can be used to strengthen the airways as an alternate treatment (1,10–13). However, the effectiveness of OPEs in alleviating sleep apnea remains under-explored for stroke patients, many of whom face unique barriers to follow-up and daily living activities. This pilot study thus aims to evaluate the feasibility of using OPEs to treat OSA in post-stroke patients who are unable to tolerate CPAP. If successful, this study could pave the way for expansive RCTs that a) strengthen the evidence behind OPEs as a novel OSA treatment and b) revitalize the scientific community’s stagnant efforts in addressing post-stroke OSA. Methodology: Population: This pilot study aims to recruit 40 participants with OSA (defined as having an Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) > 10 events/hour) and a history of stroke who were unable to tolerate a minimum 2-week CPAP trial. The exclusion criteria includes: significant cognitive impairment; depression; use of hypnotic medications; diseases impacting speech or oropharyngeal muscles; diseases or devices (e.g. oxygen therapy) that could interfere with a home sleep apnea test (14). Intervention and Comparison: Participants are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive exercises guided by a tablet-based app, either as part of the intervention or control group. The intervention group receives a daily regimen of 10 standard OPEs that have been developed from speech-language pathology and have demonstrated effectiveness in previous studies with non-stroke OSA patients (15). The sham treatment group performs mouth movements that do not impact oropharyngeal strength. This regimen was specifically chosen to address criticisms that previous studies’ use of deep breathing as a control may have resulted in inadequate blinding (16). Both groups are instructed to complete OPE/sham regimens for 30 minutes/day and 5 days/week for 6 weeks (15). Outcome: The primary outcome of this study is the feasibility of delivering OPEs for post-stroke OSA patients. Specifically, we will use our app to track a) the number of times a participant completes an OPE and b) the percentage of participants who complete at least 80% of their OPE regimen. We will also evaluate recruitment and consent rates, and the technical capacity to administer OPEs. The secondary outcomes assess OPE effectiveness in decreasing the severity of OSA in post-stroke patients, which will provide preliminary data informing future studies in the field. At baseline, post-training (6 weeks) and retention (10 weeks), we will measure participants’ OSA severity with home sleep apnea tests, sleep-related symptoms through standardized questionnaires, and oropharyngeal muscle function. Hypotheses: Our primary and secondary hypotheses are directly testable by our study protocol. Hypothesis 1: At least 80% of participants will complete 80% of their assigned regimen, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for further RCTs to assess treatment efficacy. Hypothesis 2: Compared to sham activities, OPEs will improve OSA severity, oropharyngeal muscle function and sleep quality. Feasibility Considerations: Although pilot studies do not require power calculations, we have already recruited 20/40 participants in our target sample size. This study’s principal investigator, Dr. Mark Boulos, runs a clinic seeing >500 stroke patients/year, from which he has identified an additional 20 participants who are ready for enrollment. We have also mitigated the technical uncertainties arising from COVID-19 restrictions by designing an app-based intervention and obtaining Research Ethics Board approval to conduct the study fully virtually.","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder where a person stops breathing several times during sleep due to a collapse of their upper airways. This condition is particularly common in stroke patients and can interfere with their recovery process as well as increase their chances of having another stroke. One emerging treatment for OSA could be to strengthen the upper airway muscles with daily exercises commonly used in speech-language pathology. Our study hopes to understand whether this treatment can be feasibly implemented for stroke patients with OSA, and whether it can improve their recovery process and sleep quality.",,"OPES, Sleep, Oropharyngeal, CPAP","""Sleep Apnea, Stroke""",n,Sleep,"Speech Therapy, Muscle Training","Stroke Recovery, Sleep Quality",Human,Basic,Mind and Body,University of Toronto,2021,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-lee-408965ab,,,University of Toronto,Toronto General Hospital ,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sonia Persaud,,Robin Green,A deeper dive into memory brain gains from a virtual navigation challenge,"Rationale: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (1-9). This decline may significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders (3, 5-7). The hippocampus is an area of particular vulnerability in this process: significant volumetric decline in both white and grey matter has been observed in moderate-severe TBI patients up to at least two years post-injury (9). Volume losses in the hippocampi have been linked to the reduced memory and spatial abilities observed in these patients (10). Importantly, despite the hippocampus’ susceptibility to neurodegeneration, it is also a neuroplastic brain region, which makes it a candidate target for neurorehabilitation (11-13). Our lab has developed a novel “allocentric spatial navigation” (navigating from a bird’s eye view) intervention in which participants with MS and TBI navigate through cities using Google Street View. Each week, participants are introduced to a new city, for which they must develop a “cognitive map” in their head to navigate through increasingly complex routes. The aim of this intervention is to create a continuously stimulating virtual environment for patients, harnessing the benefits of environmental enrichment (intensive cognitive stimulation) and allocentric spatial navigation, which have been shown to stave off hippocampal decline in both animal and human studies (14-18). The overarching spatial navigation study, of which this project is a part, has collected data on a wide variety of outcome measures. This study will specifically examine the data collected from the “near-transfer” tasks. Near- transfer refers to the ability of the intervention to elicit improved responses when considering situations similar to the intervention (19-20). These outcomes ensure that the intervention is influencing participants as intended. However, given that this intervention was entirely novel, we created the outcome measures for the study, and they have yet to be validated. This current project aims to provide a granular investigation of the near-transfer materials in order to validate them for ongoing use. Objective: To complete a secondary analysis of existing data from our spatial navigation intervention, examining week-to-week and within-week differences in participant responses. Participant performance will be examined for each of the study’s sixteen weeks, and an item analysis will be conducted to validate the intended properties of each outcome (e.g., complexity, difficulty). Methods Participants: Adults who have either (i) progressive MS, or (ii) sustained a moderate-severe TBI, who have completed our sixteen-week spatial navigation intervention. Outcome measures: Near-transfer spatial task materials. 1. Responses to end of day questions (proximity judgement and vector mapping tasks). 2. Performance on the Map Placement task. 3. Performance on Google Street View navigation. Design: This study is a retrospective secondary analysis which will examine week-by-week and within-week performance of TBI and MS participants across a spatial navigation intervention. Procedures: Recruitment for this study was conducted through two primary methods. MS patients were recruited via the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI)’s outpatient clinic, and TBI patients were recruited from sources including Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and TRI’s inpatient unit. Consent from all participants was provided over the telephone before participants completed a sixteen-week spatial navigation intervention, delivered remotely. As all analysis conducted will be retrospective, there is no further consent required to complete the objective outlined above. Analyses Items analysis and multiple paired t-tests will be the primary analysis conducted.","Memory and cognitive impairments have been identified as debilitating and chronic features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). These impairments have been specifically correlated with loss of volume in the hippocampus, a brain region linked to memory. Our lab has developed a training program in ""spatial navigation"" for individuals with MS and TBI, wherein participants learn how to navigate through different cities each week. Spatial navigation has been shown to reduce hippocampal volume loss in multiple populations. The current project seeks to examine week- to-week and within-week changes in performance during the program to identify areas for improvement.",,"Intervention, Spatial, Navigation, Decline, Performance","""Multiple Sclerosis, TBI""",n,"Memory, Cognition",Cognitive Training,Rehabilitation,Human,Basic,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2021,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julia Rybkina,,Robin Green,Improving Memory for People with Multiple Sclerosis can be as Simple as Virtually Navigating Cities from Home,"Background. Neurological disorders are a growing cause of disability in Canada, with rates rising as a result of increased life expectancy1,2. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) lead to debilitating, often chronic symptoms that diminish quality of life, independence and self-esteem, while increasing propensity for secondary health conditions (e.g., chronic pain, mood disorders)3-4. Up to 40-75% of individuals with MS or moderate-severe TBI exhibit cognitive decline in the domains of episodic memory, attention, information processing efficiency and executive functions3,5,6. MS and TBI can lead to progressive neurodegeneration of the hippocampi (HC), a critical brain structure for new memory formation, decision making and spatial navigation. In the MS population, studies have shown that smaller HC volumes are associated with poorer verbal and visuo-spatial episodic memory7-10. In moderate-severe TBI, progressive HC atrophy occurs after the resolution of acute neurological symptoms, and may continue for years thereafter, adversely affecting cognitive performance11-15. Some existing online cognitive training programs (e.g. RehaCom, BrainStim, BrainHQ) have proven feasible (86-95% retention, 67-92% adherence) and effective at improving training-specific task performance, but show limited neurophysiological impact and transferability of effects to activities outside of training16-19. To address these gaps, we developed with previous support from Branch Out, a novel, online memory intervention designed to offset progressive HC degeneration and improve memory. It harnesses two independent neurocognitive principles- (i) cognitive environmental enrichment, whereby engagement in continuously novel, complex, engaging and challenging cognitive stimulation promotes neuroplastic brain change and improved cognitive functions20,21 and (ii) allocentric spatial navigation, where engagement in “bird’s eye view” navigation was shown to stave off HC atrophy and to improve memory.22 Objective. To evaluate the feasibility of our allocentric spatial navigation intervention. Methods. Participants navigated through unfamiliar cities via Google StreetView using for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week for 16 weeks from their home computer, tablet or smartphone. The intervention was self-paced and level of difficulty adjusted based on performance. Feasibility parameters included recruitment, retention and adherence rates, and semi-structured interview was conducted post-intervention to assess barriers and facilitators to participation. Results. N=13 MS, N=4 TBI and N=63 older adult participants have completed the intervention to date. Across all groups, recruitment rate was 55.6%, retention rate was 89.5% and on average, participants adhered to 79.3 of 80 (99.1%) assigned sessions. In the semi- structured interview, participants reported finding the intervention very enjoyable, liked exploring novel cities from the comfort of their home, and experienced health benefits such as memory, navigation and mood improvements. A notable barrier to participation, however, was technical glitches. Next Steps. Recruitment is ongoing to determine behavioral and neurophysiological efficacy of this intervention. Despite good feasibility, technical glitches discourage participant engagement and reduce the validity and reliability of the data. By re-programming the problematic aspects of our intervention website, we hope to offer a better user experience, improve the accuracy of our data collection and set the stage for scaled up delivery of the intervention if proof-of-principle is successfully demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2021,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-rybkina-0110/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Julia-Rybkina-2189765838,,McGill University,https://kite-uhn.com/staff/julia-rybkina,,,julia.rybkina@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Valerie Caron,,Sarah Donkers,Dogging around rehabilitation: Animal-based physiotherapy for Cerebral Palsy,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common neurological condition to limit gross motor function in childhood and affects 1/400 Canadian births. (1) Brain injury prior to, during, or shortly after birth causes CP and results in motor, sensory and cognitive impairments. (1,2) Only half of the children living with CP can walk independently and often have significant difficulty ambulating safely (2,3). This limits participation in peer-groups and independent community engagement. (2,3) Current evidence and advice from our patient and family advisors (PFAs) prioritizes innovative interventions for walking and balance that motivate and promote adherence. Improved walking and balance enhances the ability of children living with CP to participate with peers in their community. (2,4-6). Animal- assisted interventions (AAIs) are creative and unique rehabilitation options. Evidence supports their effectiveness in neurological paediatric populations for improved walking and balance, social functioning, and psychological wellbeing. (7-13) AAIs using dogs specifically are not as well documented, and there are significant methodological, evaluation, and reporting limitations leaving gaps in the literature. (9-12) Research suggests “therapy dogs” decrease stress and pain, and improve attitude and quality of life (9-12); however, “therapy dogs” do not have consistent training standards making it difficult to measure their impact. Rehabilitation dogs are highly trained to support walking and balance training and have demonstrated benefits in a rehabilitation setting with other neurological populations. (13) The psychosocial impacts from AAIs combined with the use of a highly-trained and certified rehabilitation dog to target balance and walking have not been investigated. This research will pilot an innovative intervention integrating a rehabilitation dog as a novel approach to improve walking and balance, and overall quality of life for children living with CP. Hypotheses & Objectives: 1. To assess changes following a comprehensive, individualized 8-week balance and walking intervention for children with CP using a rehabilitation dog. Hypothesis: Using a rehabilitation dog will augment typical gait training to show meaningful improvements in walking and balance for participants. Outcomes: Averages and variability of spatiotemporal gait parameters, balance control, neuromuscular parameters (EMG) and clinical walking and balance measures pre/post intervention will be compared. 2. To determine the qualitative impact by exploring participants’ experiences and perspectives related to working with a rehabilitation dog and to better understand the effects of this intervention on motivation, confidence, quality of life, and increase in age-appropriate participation level activity. Hypothesis: Motivation for age- appropriate activities, independence and community participation, and psychological wellbeing will improve following interventions using the rehabilitation dog. Outcomes: Subjective and multimedia descriptions provided by participants and their families will be explored using an interpretive description. A semi-structured interview will be used to explore themes and experiences identified. Methods: This study will aim to recruit 30 participants (aged 8-18 years, living with CP, gross motor function classification system II-III) (14). As this is a pilot study, our sample size is estimated using current flat rules of thumb, anticipating a medium effect size (0.3-0.5) in our main trial. (15,16) Sex and gender will be self/guardian categorized with a recruitment goal of 15 males and 15 females to examine sex- based differences. (17,18) Gender will be examined using correlational analyses according to boy/girl or man/woman identities indicated on a visual analog scale. A baseline assessment (0 months) will be followed by a 2-month waiting period for each child to act as their own control. The waiting period is necessary due to the high intra- and inter- participant differences when working with children living with CP. (19) A pre-intervention assessment at 2 months will be followed by an 8-week individualized physiotherapy intervention using the rehabilitation dog. Children will have a post- intervention assessment (4 months) and a final follow-up assessment at 6 months. The post-intervention interviews will be conducted at the 6-month follow-up. At each assessment (0, 2, 4 and 6 months) participants will walk along a 10m walkway with their typical walking aid and then with the rehabilitation dog. Using inertial movement sensors (XSens, Netherlands), electromyography (Noraxon, USA) and the MiniBESTest (20), we will evaluate walking performance, neuromuscular control, and balance control, respectively. Patient-identified outcome measures, such as the paediatric quality of life inventory, Activity-specific Balance Confidence scale, and the Human-Animal Interaction Scale will also be completed pre and post intervention. (21-24) Throughout the AAI, participants and their families will describe their experience using multimedia to support connection and interest in the intervention and to inform the post-intervention interviews. (25-30) These semi- structured interviews will ask about perspectives and experiences related to the intervention to identify meaningful and impactful characteristics and themes of the AAI. (25-30) Impact: This project proposes an innovative and individualized approach to walking and balance training that will inform future research intervention protocols, priorities, and clinical applications as well as improve access to this unique AAI. We are using a patient-centered approach that prioritizes collaboration with PFAs throughout the project and aligns directly with the translation, solution and impact components of the idea to impact framework. Working with PFAs’ ensures direct alignment with patient-identified priorities and will lead to meaningful impact on quality of life and increased participation in age-appropriate activities. By evaluating patient experiences and insights relating to the rehabilitation dog, we will identify the way that our intervention positively influences rehabilitation enjoyment and adherence. These are critical to enhancing training and impacting change at the participation level and promote independence. Gaining independence as a child living with CP can support lifespan social engagement and increase physical activity levels, which influence long term health and associated health care costs. There are long wait-lists and large costs associated with accessing service dogs. Our findings may help to identify who benefits from working with a rehabilitation dog in therapy vs. who might benefit from their own personal mobility service animal.

Vjura Senthilnathan,,Sarah Munce,Being Mindful about Mindfulness Interventions in Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating event with lifelong consequences. In addition to being at risk for secondary complications such as pain, individuals with SCI are also at risk of experiencing issues with their mental health and wellbeing (Savic et al., 2000; Paker et al., 2006; Noreau et al., 2000). Major depression is one of the most common psychological conditions associated with SCI, affecting 25-30% of SCI patients living in our community (Craig et al., 2009). Having depression and SCI has been associated with poorer outcomes, higher incidence of hospitalization and secondary medical issues as well as poor social integration and quality of life (Elliott et al., 2004). The results from a systematic review on mindfulness-based interventions for SCI individuals provided some support for the use of mindfulness to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hearn & Cross, 2020). However, due to the limited number of studies that assessed mindfulness interventions in SCI patients, these researchers emphasized that these conclusions were preliminary (Hearn & Cross, 2020). They further concluded that there is a need to investigate the preferred adaptations for a mindfulness-based intervention for SCI, including the frequency and length of the intervention, the optimal level of motivation for participants, and the possible need for follow-up sessions to maintain benefits, combined educational resources, and interaction among participants (Hearn & Finlay, 2018; Hearn & Cross, 2020). Thus, the purpose of this project is to determine the considerations to implement an online mindfulness- based intervention that fulfills the specific preferences of SCI individuals. The specific research objectives of the current proposal are to 1) understand the preferred components (i.e., specific content of the intervention, who should deliver the intervention, how should the intervention be delivered, how many times should the intervention be delivered and over what period of time, etc.), barriers and enablers of implementing an online mindfulness-based intervention from the perspective of SCI individuals (Phase 1); and 2) to determine the importance attributed to the identified components of an online mindfulness-based intervention (i.e., prioritize the components identified in Specific Research Objective 1) from the perspective of SCI individuals (Phase 2). My Masters’ thesis will focus on Specific Research Objective 2; however, I will be involved in both phases as my project is dependent on the outcomes of Specific Research Objective 1. The proposed research will be conducted in two phases using a mixed-methods approach. Specifically, an exploratory sequential design (qualitative followed by quantitative) will be used. This approach has been previously used to design an online self-management program and is an acceptable design for developing complex interventions (Munce et al., 2014a; Munce et al., 2016a; Munce et al., 2020). Furthermore, an integrated knowledge (iKT) approach will be adopted in this research project. iKT is defined as an ongoing relationship between researchers and decision-makers, including patients and families, for the purpose of engaging in a mutually beneficial research project to support decision-making (Kothari et al., 2013). Using this approach has been associated with creating more effective and sustainable interventions (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2015). Phase 1 will use a qualitative descriptive approach and involve semi-structured interviews with approximately 20 SCI individuals. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication framework (Hoffmann et al., 2014) will be used to inform the interview guide. Probes or recursive questioning will be used during interviews to explore issues in greater depth and verify the understanding of the information being collected. Examples of these questions may include: “What is your experience with mindfulness training? What specific content should be included in an online mindfulness program? Probe: Individually? Group setting? Why? “. Community-based SCI patients (i.e., no longer participating in a comprehensive rehabilitation program) who 1) had their injury at least 1 year ago; 2) are over the age of 18; 3) fluent in English, and 4) can provide informed consent will be recruited. Patients who are medically unstable or have active suicidal ideation will be excluded from this study. Participants will be recruited using social media (Facebook and Twitter) and online advertisements posted on websites of community-based organizations including SCI Canada and its provincial chapters. All interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for data analysis. Recruitment will continue until the point of data saturation, which is the point when successive interviews become repetitive and no new responses or themes emerge (Creswell et al., 2003). For Phase 2, data collection will occur through self-report surveys using SurveyMonkey, based on the themes identified from Phase 1. In addition to collecting data such as socio-demographic and injury-related variables, participants will also be asked to rate the importance attributed to various factors: the content areas of the program, who should deliver this program, and how the program be delivered. The survey will use a Likert-type scale with five response options (1= very unimportant to 5 = very important). Depending on what barriers and enablers were identified in Phase 1, themes that correspond to various measures may be implemented to see how these preferences change by mood, levels of pain, self-efficacy/confidence and/or mastery. Some possible measures include The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan et al., 1995); Moorong Self-efficacy Scale (MSES) (Middleton et al., 2003); and the Pearlin- Schooler Mastery Scale (PMS) (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). I will aim to recruit 126 individuals with SCI across Canada using the same recruitment methods in Phase 1. To calculate sample size, an expected proportion of 0.5, a desired precision/total confidence interval width of 0.2 and a 95% confidence interval was used, which resulted in 104 participants (Hulley et al., 2013). Based on a previous national survey with SCI individuals (Munce et al., 2014a), it is estimated that approximately 20% of the sample will not complete the survey. Thus, a total of 126 individuals with SCI will be recruited for Phase 2.

Vjura Senthilnathan,,Sarah Munce,Being Mindful about Mindfulness Interventions in Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating event with lifelong consequences. In addition to being at risk for secondary complications such as pain, individuals with SCI are also at risk of experiencing issues with their mental health and wellbeing (Savic et al., 2000; Paker et al., 2006; Noreau et al., 2000). Major depression is one of the most common psychological conditions associated with SCI, affecting 25-30% of SCI patients living in our community (Craig et al., 2009). Having depression and SCI has been associated with poorer outcomes, higher incidence of hospitalization and secondary medical issues as well as poor social integration and quality of life (Elliott et al., 2004). The results from a systematic review on mindfulness-based interventions for SCI individuals provided some support for the use of mindfulness to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hearn & Cross, 2020). However, due to the limited number of studies that assessed mindfulness interventions in SCI patients, these researchers emphasized that these conclusions were preliminary (Hearn & Cross, 2020). They further concluded that there is a need to investigate the preferred adaptations for a mindfulness-based intervention for SCI, including the frequency and length of the intervention, the optimal level of motivation for participants, and the possible need for follow-up sessions to maintain benefits, combined educational resources, and interaction among participants (Hearn & Finlay, 2018; Hearn & Cross, 2020). Thus, the purpose of this project is to determine the considerations to implement an online mindfulness- based intervention that fulfills the specific preferences of SCI individuals. The specific research objectives of the current proposal are to 1) understand the preferred components (i.e., specific content of the intervention, who should deliver the intervention, how should the intervention be delivered, how many times should the intervention be delivered and over what period of time, etc.), barriers and enablers of implementing an online mindfulness-based intervention from the perspective of SCI individuals (Phase 1); and 2) to determine the importance attributed to the identified components of an online mindfulness-based intervention (i.e., prioritize the components identified in Specific Research Objective 1) from the perspective of SCI individuals (Phase 2). My Masters’ thesis will focus on Specific Research Objective 2; however, I will be involved in both phases as my project is dependent on the outcomes of Specific Research Objective 1. The proposed research will be conducted in two phases using a mixed-methods approach. Specifically, an exploratory sequential design (qualitative followed by quantitative) will be used. This approach has been previously used to design an online self-management program and is an acceptable design for developing complex interventions (Munce et al., 2014a; Munce et al., 2016a; Munce et al., 2020). Furthermore, an integrated knowledge (iKT) approach will be adopted in this research project. iKT is defined as an ongoing relationship between researchers and decision-makers, including patients and families, for the purpose of engaging in a mutually beneficial research project to support decision-making (Kothari et al., 2013). Using this approach has been associated with creating more effective and sustainable interventions (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2015). Phase 1 will use a qualitative descriptive approach and involve semi-structured interviews with approximately 20 SCI individuals. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication framework (Hoffmann et al., 2014) will be used to inform the interview guide. Probes or recursive questioning will be used during interviews to explore issues in greater depth and verify the understanding of the information being collected. Examples of these questions may include: “What is your experience with mindfulness training? What specific content should be included in an online mindfulness program? Probe: Individually? Group setting? Why? “. Community-based SCI patients (i.e., no longer participating in a comprehensive rehabilitation program) who 1) had their injury at least 1 year ago; 2) are over the age of 18; 3) fluent in English, and 4) can provide informed consent will be recruited. Patients who are medically unstable or have active suicidal ideation will be excluded from this study. Participants will be recruited using social media (Facebook and Twitter) and online advertisements posted on websites of community-based organizations including SCI Canada and its provincial chapters. All interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for data analysis. Recruitment will continue until the point of data saturation, which is the point when successive interviews become repetitive and no new responses or themes emerge (Creswell et al., 2003). For Phase 2, data collection will occur through self-report surveys using SurveyMonkey, based on the themes identified from Phase 1. In addition to collecting data such as socio-demographic and injury-related variables, participants will also be asked to rate the importance attributed to various factors: the content areas of the program, who should deliver this program, and how the program be delivered. The survey will use a Likert-type scale with five response options (1= very unimportant to 5 = very important). Depending on what barriers and enablers were identified in Phase 1, themes that correspond to various measures may be implemented to see how these preferences change by mood, levels of pain, self-efficacy/confidence and/or mastery.

"Shannon Dunn, Jen Gommerman",,"Shannon Dunn, Jen Gommerman",Factors of Risk and Resilience in Multiple Sclerosis,"Despite the advances in the treatment of acute attacks in MS, there is still no cure for this disease, and current therapies have little impact in slowing disability progression (1). Therefore, preventing MS remains an important goal. A number of studies have identified environmental and genetic factors that increase the risk of developing MS (2). However, there is a substantial need to understand the biology linking these factors to the initiation of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. Understanding this biology will improve our understanding of how this disease gets started and may reveal new ways of stopping this disease in the early stages before it can erupt into a chronic disorder. Over the past decades, it has become evident that even mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), without loss of consciousness, can trigger chronic neurological problems (3, 4). Although traumatic brain injury was proposed as a potential cause of MS in the earliest descriptions of this disorder (5), only recently has solid evidence come to light linking brain trauma to development of this disease (6, 7). In 2015, a metanalysis reported a statistically significant association between traumatic head injury in childhood and development of MS (odds-ratio, OR=1.3), when “high-quality” studies were considered together (6). More recently, a very large case-control study of MS patients and unaffected individuals from the Swedish Patient and MS Registries reported a significant association between MS risk and the occurrence of concussion (OR=1.22), and this association was even higher (OR=2.3) in those experiencing recurrent injury (7). Interestingly, this same study found that the association between concussion and MS risk was significant in adolescence, not in childhood, consistent with the emerging evidence that adolescence is an important MS susceptibility window (8). How concussions predispose the brain to MS is not known, but has been speculated to occur as a result of the damage to the myelin and the associated activation of myelin-reactive T cells (7). Supporting this idea, post-mortem studies conducted on individuals who suffered concussions, but died by other causes, revealed the presence of microglia activation and multifocal axonal injury in the major white matter tracts including the corpus callosum, fornix and cerebellum (9). Similar myelin disturbances have been observed in a murine model of mTBI (10). There is also evidence from studies in animal models that CNS trauma can activate myelin- specific T cells. For example, a cryoinjury delivered to the cortex during the pre-clinical stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, enhanced the severity of this disease by increasing immune cell infiltration into the CNS (11). Furthermore, in a spinal cord contusion model in Lewis rats, it was shown that T cells specific against myelin basic protein (MBP) could be expanded from injured rats and transfer a mild form of EAE to non- injured rats, proving that myelin-specific T cells can be sensitized by this type of injury (12, 13). Yet in another study in Lewis rats, it was shown that T cell recruitment to the spinal cord could be induced by a stab lesion to the brain, but only when this injury was coupled with the injection of the innate cytokine IL-12 (14). The common underlying theme in these studies is that severe CNS injury can lead to the sensitization of myelin-reactive T cells. No one has yet investigated whether a mild “closed” head trauma modeling concussion has the same potential to induce autoimmunity. Nonetheless, proof of the concept that sterile myelin injury can induce autoimmunity is provided by the recent finding that cuprizone-induced demyelination can trigger T cell infiltration to corpus callosum when this intervention is coupled with the injection of adjuvants that stimulate the innate immune system (15). The model of mild traumatic brain injury. mTBI has been modelled in mice and rats (16). In this grant proposal, we will use the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of closed head injury in mice, originally described by Flierl et al. (17) because it mimics the majority of clinically encountered injuries sustained on a closed skull during traffic accidents, violent attacks, or falls (17). In this model, a guided, blunt-ended probe is dropped from a defined height onto the exposed skull of the mouse (17-19). By controlling the height of the weight drop, one can modulate the severity of CNS trauma. Our team member, Dr. Ramaglia, found that a single CCI produced by weight drop from a 1 cm height causes concussive-like symptoms in 8 week old male C57BL6/J mice, with transient disturbances in neurological function that resolve within 48 h. Pathologically, a 1 cm drop does not result in Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) leakage and shows only low levels of complement deposition and microglia activation, whereas a single drop from 2 cm height induced more extensive inflammation, BBB injury, and axonal damage. Though other models of mTBI have been shown to cause myelin disturbances, whether CCI induces demyelination has not yet been studied. In the first aim of this grant, we will calibrate the model by examining the effect of single or multiple CCI at 1 or 2 cm heights on inflammation, myelin and axon integrity and neurological function. Once we decide on the optimal drop height, we will follow with studies to test whether single or multiple CCI will trigger CNS autoimmunity development or worsen established EAE. The 2D2 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse (2D2 mouse). The 2D2 mouse originally developed by Dr. Vijay Kuchroo and colleagues (20), expresses the Valpha and Vbeta chains of a TCR specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Because the TCR has a low affinity for MOG antigen, these T cells escape negative selection and populate the periphery of mice at high frequency (20). Due to the high abundance of myelin-specific T cells, 2D2 mice develop a spontaneous form of EAE at low incidence (5% in our colony) and this incidence increases upon exposure to environmental factors or loss of genes controlling T cell tolerance (21-23). In this grant, we will induce CCI in this autoimmune prone strain alongside non- transgenic C57BL6/J mice. We hypothesize that mTBI will have the potential to sensitize myelin reactive T cells to initiate autoimmunity. This will be tested through the following aims: Aim 1. Calibrate the CCI model to replicate the transient nature of neurological dysfunction and myelin damage seen in human concussion injury. We will also investigate the effect of multiple CCIs, administered 2 weeks apart on inflammation and myelin pathology. Aim 2. To determine whether single or repeated CCI induces autoimmunity or worsens established EAE. First, we will subject mice to single or multiple CCI or sham surgery and will assess the expansion of myelin-reactive T cells, CNS pathology, and clinical symptoms in these mice post-injury. If CCI alone cannot trigger autoimmunity, we will couple CCI with the injection of adjuvants to stimulate the immune system. These experiments will be performed in both 2D2 and C57BL6/J mice. In a second experiment, we will examine whether a single CCI will worsen established EAE in male C57BL6/J mice. Deliverable: These experiments will provide mechanistic insights into how closed head injury may trigger MS and provide a pre-clinical model that can serve as a test ground for agents to prevent the development of CNS autoimmunity. Aim 1. Calibrate the CCI model to replicate the transient nature of neurological dysfunction and myelin damage seen in human concussion injury. Dr. Ramaglia, a member of this team, previously constructed the apparatus and implemented the CCI model while in Amsterdam (18, 19). As a first step, we will establish the model here in Toronto, building the apparatus with the specifications described in (17). Since the severity of brain injury is affected by features of the apparatus such as resistance to weight drop and the mice used (e.g., strain, sex, and body weight)(17), the first goal is to calibrate the model in order that CCI induces myelin damage, but only a transient loss in neurological function. Given our past experience, we will start by testing the effects of single CCI at 1 and 2 cm heights on 12 week-old male C57BL6/J and 2D2 mice (N=6 mice/strain/height)(18, 19). Because female mice are more susceptible to injury- associated mortality(17), we will only calibrate the model in females, once establishing the optimal drop height in males (see below). CCI. Mice will be anaesthetized with isoflurane. The skin overlying the skull will be incised to expose the skull. The rod, will be released from a set height to target a site just lateral to the sagittal suture and ventral to the coronal suture on one side of the skull. The skin will be sutured closed and mice will be given analgesic and placed on a heat mat to recover. Measures. Mice will be evaluated for neurological impairment after each injury at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days, and 2 wks post-injury, using the neurological severity scale (NSS)(17, 19). At 2 wks after CCI, mice will be euthanized, perfused with PBS followed by formalin and the brain will be harvested, fixed and embedded in paraffin. In half of the mice, we will conduct an analysis of inflammation (CD3 antibody for T cells, Iba-1 and Mac-3 antibodies for microglia/monocyte activation(24)), myelin damage (QD9 antibody)(25), axonal injury (SMI-32 and APP antibodies), blood-brain barrier leakage (anti-albumin)(19). Staining will be quantified as previously described(18, 19), using the ImageJ analysis software. In the other half of mice, we will fix the corpus callosom and embed it in resin for ultrastructural studies of myelin by transmission electron microscopy. Follow-up Plans: If we find that the 1 cm height is not sufficient to induce myelin damage or that the injury produced by the 2 cm height is too severe in males, we will test an intermediate height. Once the optimal weight drop height for a single CCI is determined for males, we will calibrate the CCI model on females, testing smaller drop heights. We will also follow with studies to examine the effects of repeated CCI (3 in total, separated by 2 weeks) on brain pathology and neurological functioning (by NSS) in male and female mice. For these studies, NSS will be monitored throughout and pathology evaluated at 2 weeks following the last CCI. Optimal conditions identified will be carried over for Aim 2. Aim 2. To determine whether CCI induces autoimmunity or worsens established EAE. Once we have calibrated the apparatus to produce a mild TBI, we will proceed with studies to evaluate the potential of single or multiple CCI to induce CNS autoimmunity (Question 1) or enhance established EAE (Question 2). Question 1. Can CCI induce CNS autoimmunity? We will start by treating C57BL6/J and 2D2 (N=5/group/sex/strain) to one or three CCI using the optimal drop height for each sex. Studies will be conducted in both sexes to explore sex differences in the development of CNS autoimmunity in response to mTBI. Sham-operated controls will have a surgery at the same time as CCI with no weight drop. Following CCI or sham surgery, mice will be monitored and scored according to NSS and EAE scales(26) for 28 days. At end-point, we will harvest the brain and spinal cord and conduct a histopathological analysis of inflammation, damaged myelin, and axonal injury as described above. The expansion of myelin-reactive T cells will be evaluated at end-point using IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-17 ELISPOT assays and thymidine incorporation assays (26, 27). For ELISPOT assays, mononuclear cells isolated from the cervical lymph nodes and spleen and will be plated in the absence or presence of myelin antigens (MBP or MOG) on ELISPOT plates pre-coated with cytokine antibodies. Cytokine spots will be developed after 24 h and the number of myelin-specific-cytokine secreting cells will be counted. MBP and MOG specific antibody titres will also be evaluated in the serum of mice at endpoint by ELISA (28). Expected Outcomes/Follow-up plans. These experiments will tell us whether single or multiple CCI are sufficient to induce autoimmunity in C57BL6/J mice or in 2D2 mice. Contrasting the effect of the CCI in two strains will also provide us with insights into how the CCI is triggering autoimmunity. If CCI is not sufficient to induce autoimmunity, we will repeat studies except that we will couple the injury with injection of Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) and pertussis toxin (PTX)(15) at the time of injury to boost the innate immune system. These agents will not be given to 2D2 mice since these stimuli are sufficient to cause EAE in this strain (20). Question 2. Can CCI worsen established EAE in C57BL6/J mice? We will explore the effect of a single CCI on the course of EAE in male C57BL6 mice. Disease wil be induced (N=20 mice) via immunization with MOG peptide 35-55/CFA and injection of PTX(26). During the pre-clinical phase of EAE (day 6 post-immunization), half of the group will receive a single CCI, the other half, a sham surgery. Mice will be followed for the severity of clinical signs for 30 days after which we will conduct histological analysis of inflammation, demyelination, and axon injury in the CNS. Expected Outcome. We expect that CCI may also enhanced CNS inflammation through activation of microglia at the injury site and increased T cell and monocyte recruitment to the CNS.","Adolescents engaged in contact-sports can suffer from recurrent brain concussions with no loss of consciousness and no need for hospitalization, yet they face the possibility of long-term neurocognitive problems. Recent studies suggest that head concussive injuries during adolescence can also predispose individuals to multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms of how brain injury triggers MS are not understood. Here, we hypothesize that myelin damage triggered by the concussive injury leads to the activation of immune cells that recognize myelin, the protective coating on neurons, thereby triggering an autoimmune attack on the brain. This hypothesis will be tested using a mouse model of head concussion. In this model, we use a weight-drop device to deliver a mild head injury or repeated mild head injuries to mice. The first goal of the project is to calibrate the model to ensure that the injury is mild enough to induce only transient neurological disturbances, yet severe enough to cause disturbances in the myelin sheath and brain inflammation similar to that seen in human concussion injury. Once established, we will then investigate whether a concussion-like injury can trigger an MS-like disease in mice. We will also investigate whether concussive injury can worsen established autoimmunity in mice. Understanding these mechanisms will guide the development of timed and targeted therapies to prevent MS from getting started in people at risk.",,"Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI), Mice, Injury, Myelin, Autoimmunity, Central Nervous System (CNS)","""Concussion, Multiple Sclerosis""",n,Myelination,n/a,MS Prevention,Animal,"Basic, Translational","Mind and Body, Nutraceutical",University of Toronto,2021,43000,43000,,,,,,,"43,000.00","43,000.00",Seed,Seed,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=zsIBd1MAAAAJ    https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=DQoAYuwAAAAJ ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-gommerman-514a8126b/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shannon-Dunn-6    https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Jen-Gommerman-2174828857 ,,University of Toronto,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isabel Hedayat,,Alison Oates,Use of Haptic Anchors to Improve Balance and Mobility in Aging Populations,"Final Report Project Summary: Rationale: Falling unintentionally is a major health issue for older adults and individuals with balance impairments. Sensori-motor integration is an important component of walking, as it gives the body more sensory information on where it is in space and where the limbs are in comparison. Haptic input (via light touch) provides the brain with a reference to the environment, the position and orientation of the arms, and cutaneous information about the surface being touched (1). Common clinical haptic tools include a rigid railing (2) and haptic anchors (3). Rigid railing is a stiff, unmoving surface that one can run their finger along while walking to provide haptic input (2). Haptic anchors are small weights connected to a cord that is held in the hands while the weights drag on the floor during movement (3). Walking with haptic input from a rigid railing (2) or haptic anchors (3) has been shown to increase walking stability, but there has been no comparison of each tool’s effect on walking stability. Methods: My project involved quantitatively comparing the effect of the haptic anchors and rigid railing on balance during walking in 30 healthy young adults (age 18-50 years). Walking trials with either tool were compared to trials with no light touch input. A Mobility Lab (APDM, Oregon, USA) was used to measure gait variables for each walking trial. Primary measures for quantifying walking balance were percent of time standing on both feet (4), walking velocity (4), and magnitude and duration of trunk sway (3). Individual perspectives on both types of haptic input tool were qualitatively looked at using a set of visual analog scales. Major findings: Preliminary data analysis (n=20) has shown that both the rail and anchors improve walking stability by significantly decreasing peak trunk movement velocity from in the frontal plane, and anchors caused a significant decrease compared to the railing. Also, while both tools caused a significant decrease in walking velocity, the trials with rail result in a significantly altered walking pattern by changing percent of time on both feet, while the anchors have no difference in walking pattern to walking with no light touch. No significant difference in preferences or opinions of either tool has been found. Implications: These findings give better insight to how haptic tools affect walking stability, and the information could be used in a clinical rehabilitation setting to improve balance during walking. 1: Rabin, E., Chen, J., Muratori, L., DiFransisco-Donoghue, J., Werner, W., 2013.

Research has shown that lightly touching a surface while standing and while walking improves our stability. There are two main clinical haptic tools that have been used for haptic input: rigid railing, and haptic anchors. Rigid railing is a stiff horizontal beam that a finger lightly rests on while standing or walking. Haptic anchors are essentially beanbags on strings, and the bean bags are dragged along the ground as an individual walks. My study this year looked at how the tools each affected walking stability in young healthy adults, and we found that both tools improved stability by decreasing side-to-side trunk movement, but the anchors did so even more. We also included a survey to determine how individuals perceived the tools to affect their walking, and found that participants thought both tools helped their walking the same amount. Our results can help guide future research in how these tools affect walking stability in populations with walking or balance impairments, such as those with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, incomplete spinal cord injuries, and even older adults.",,"Walking, Haptic Anchors, Balance, Stability, Gait",,n,Stability,"Tactile Device, Haptic Anchors",Mobility,Human,"Basic, Translational, Clinical Trial",Mind and Body,University of Saskatchewan,2015,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/use_of_haptic_anchors_to_improve_balance_and_mobility_in_aging_populations,,0,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isabel-Hedayat,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Kaeli Knudsen,,Carlos Carvalho,"Epigenetics, the  New Frontier ","Final Report Project Summary: Neurodevelopmental disorders in humans have been associated with changes in chromatin markers suggesting that epigenetics may contribute to complex behavioural predispositions. An example is substance abuse that can lead to addictive behaviours like alcoholism; to date there is no definitive evidence advocating for a genetic basis for alcoholism. As in humans, ethanol has neurodepressive effects on the behaviour of C. elegans. Worms usually avoid ethanol, however, this initial repulsion can be overcome by a prolonged ethanol exposure. It is not well known how ethanol exposure impacts the epigenome and if it does or does not influence ethanol sensitivity of later generations. While investigating the effect of preconditioning in ethanol avoidance behaviour through chemotaxis assays, we found that hermaphrodites exposed to 600 mM of ethanol for 4 hours (P0) show a distinct tendency to track towards an ethanol source when tested. In contrast to control animals, adults of the first (F1) and second (F2) generations derived from selfing P0 ancestors display the ethanol-preference behaviour to a similar magnitude despite never been exposed to ethanol themselves. This starts to wane in the F3 generation, though most worms still track towards the source of ethanol. The results above are consistent with a transgenerational effect triggered by epigenetic switches in the P0 generation upon exposure to ethanol. An epigenetic basis for the altered ethanol taxis behaviour predicts a role of the male or female germline through imprinting. We tested whether exposed males could elicit the same effect on the progeny when mated to females that had not been exposed to ethanol. Our results suggest that the switch involved happens specifically during spermatogenesis. Epigenetic switches in C. elegans are restricted to histone modifications. We have looked in the germline of worms displaying the ethanol-preference behaviour for global differences in histone methylation patterns by antibody staining. We have detected a significant increase of H3K27 methylation in pachytene chromosomes of these worms compared to controls though the relevance of this has yet to be verified. The next step is to test worms with mutations in the upstream pathways of ethanol signalling and downstream modifiers. So far we have found that dopamine, not serotonin, appears to be necessary for the acquisition of ethanol tolerance, but is not required for the transgenerational effect that we have seen. We plan to continue this research further with several mutants.","Final Report Lay Summary: Ethanol can produce neurodepressive symptoms that can lead to dependency in many other organisms, very similar to that seen in humans. A bigger, and much more controversial, issue is whether or not this dependency can then be passed on to future generations of children. By utilizing C. elegans, a microscopic nematode, we are able to test whether exposing a parental generation to ethanol has any effect on the offspring it produces, without ever exposing that subsequent generation. We have been able to see that the following two generations do have a tendency to move towards ethanol, compared to the offspring of worms which have not been exposed, and that this is paternally inherited. We now want to focus on specific genes and pathways which may be involved in the transmission of the preference to ethanol.",,"Ethanol, Worms, Behaviour, Epigenetic, Methylation",Addiction,y,Epigenetics,"Biomarker, Ethanol","Genetics, Inheritance",Animal,Basic,Nutraceutical,University of Saskatchewan,2015,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/exploring_epigenetic_changes_in_worm_model_of_addiction,,0,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaeli-knudsen-2a1a66184/,,,,Med-Life Discoveries,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is, does inducing a state of hyperoxia (excess oxygen) have beneficial effects for humans? It is worrisome that little is known about hyperoxia but there have been increased usage of oxygen bars that often claim of benefits including boosting energy, increasing attention, and so forth when using oxygen. In order to explore the potential effects of oxygen in the human brain, we examined awake spontaneous EEG activity across normoxia and hyperoxic situations for both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) were also recorded. Although hyperoxia influenced heart rate, we observed no effects on steady state EEG in either resting awake conditions. These results have implications towards clinical and recreational uses of oxygen.","Final Report Lay Summary: When the brain does not get enough oxygen, this is bad.

Considering that the Eph-ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been implicated in the propagation of immunoexcitotoxicity and subsequent disruption of normal mitochondrial metabolic functions, we conducted a pilot study to examine the effect of an EphA receptor antagonist, protocatechuic acid (PCA), on behaviour and mitochondrial function in a rat model of pediatric mTBI. Mild traumatic brain injury was induced in a cohort of male rats at P30 using a modified weight-drop technique followed by daily oral administration of PCA (125 mg/kg) or placebo in jelly for one week after injury or, in the case of controls, sham injury. Twenty-four hours following the injury, the beam walk task validated the presence of a TBI with rats subjected to the weight drop experiencing impaired motor coordination and balance. In order to evaluate behavioural effects of the drug, novel context mismatch and elevated plus maze tasks were conducted. Drug-treated rats exhibited altered emotionality but no significant change in working memory was observed relative to placebo controlled animals. Mitochondrial function, measured using the ex-vivo Seahorse XF-24 assay post-sacrifice (P45), was found to be altered between mTBI groups with drug-treated animals exhibiting a trend towards decreased non-mitochondrial respiration. While production of ATP was not significantly different between drug and placebo mTBI groups, mTBI animals showed a significant decrease, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction was present following induction of a head injury.

Victorita Ivan,,Aaron Gruber,Could Ibogaine be a natural treatment to reset drug addiction?,"Final Report Project Summary: Ibogaine is a natural substance that has been posited to attenuate the craving experienced by people struggling with drug addiction, and is therefore helpful for people attempting to break the addiction cycle and become healthy. We still know little about how Ibogaine affects the brain. This project aims to correlate behavioural data with electrophysiological recordings in order to investigate how Ibogaine affects neural signaling after prolonged exposure to a highly addictive drug (chronic amphetamine). Preliminary data from our lab suggests that the amphetamine model of addiction causes the formation of overly-strong patterns of activity in the cortex and striatum. We speculate that this might underlie the compulsive thoughts and habitual drug-taking in addiction, due to a ‘simplification’ of neural dynamics, which diminishes the behavioural and neural flexibility. In order to study this hypothesis, we will implant rats with recording electrodes in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Prelimbic Cortex and Ventral Striatum. We will then record from these animals while performing various choice tasks with and without the influence of amphetamine, in order to determine the neural and behavioural changes due to the drug. After assessing these changes, half of the cohort will be administered Ibogaine HCl (40mg/kg) while their decisions during the tasks and brain activity are recorded.

Wesley Vuong,,Clayton Dickson,The Effects of Hyperoxia During Napping Conditions,"Final Report Project Summary: A fundamental aspect of existence is to sleep. We spend over a third of our lives sleeping, yet the reason why we sleep is still unclear. Past work in our lab found that transient administration of elevated oxygen concentrations during resting-state conditions leads to significant changes in brain activity. We were interested to see if oxygen had similar effects during napping conditions. We had participants come in for two sessions spaced one week apart. Each participant was given either regular air or elevated levels of oxygen in their first session and then received the opposite condition in their following session. In each session, we used a 32-channel EEG system to record brain activity. We also used a respiration belt to record respiration rate and an oximeter to record heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels. Participants slept for 90-minutes before we woke them. We also had participants fill out a questionnaire about their sleep quality and duration prior to the nap. Our preliminary findings suggest that oxygen may play a role in reducing slow wave sleep, the deepest stage of sleep. This suggests that oxygen can potentially influence sleep quality and alertness.","Final Report Lay Summary: Can you change your brain activity just by breathing in more oxygen?

We investigated the efficacy of the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a potential ICH therapy, hypothesizing that NAC would improve behaviour and lessen neural injury in rat by increasing endogenous antioxidant glutathione, thereby mitigating oxidative damage. Animals were trained on Montoya staircase, a skilled reaching task for four weeks. NAC (75 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline was given IP 2hrs post-ICH, as well as once everyday post-ICH for 7 days. Animals were tested on reaching task for five days prior to being euthanized at Day 28 (post-ICH). Although NAC failed to improve behavioural recovery at multiple doses, it reduced lesion volume at lower doses. Negative results with the higher doses are likely due to peripheral side effects. Overall, NAC is not markedly beneficial after ICH, but further study is underway to further improve efficacy.","Final Report Lay Summary: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating stroke sub-type that claims half of its victims.

Jasmine Aziz,,Fred (Frederick) Colbourne,Can enriched environments improve hemorrhagic stroke outcomes?,"Final Report Project Summary: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating stroke subtype characterized by vessel rupture. Since there is no established cure, rehabilitation (REHAB) is the gold standard of treatment, but the mechanisms of rehabilitative recovery remain poorly understood. Following the initial bleed, the hematoma breaks down into cytotoxic blood products, which contribute to chronic injury. Given that this damage occurs over days to weeks, rehabilitative timing is important for maximizing treatment efficacy. Our lab has recently found evidence that REHAB (i.e., skilled reaching training combined with environmental enrichment) may accelerate hematoma clearance in an ICH rat model. This project examined how duration of REHAB influences functional recovery after ICH, and whether this recovery is linked to hematoma clearance. Rats were given an ICH and randomly assigned to a REHAB duration of one or two weeks, or to a control group. Skilled reaching ability and blood volume were assessed after the intervention period. Although both REHAB durations enhanced reaching function, neither reduced hemorrhage volume. This may be due to the hemoglobin assay’s lack of specificity, and follow-up REHAB experiments are underway using more precise methods (e.g., Western blot). Findings build on the small but growing literature on therapeutic timing after ICH and have implications for future mechanistic work in the REHAB field.",Final Report Lay Summary: How does rehabilitation interact with the brain’s natural recovery processes?

Elani Bykowski,,Jon Doan,The Effect of Ice Skating on Mobility Issues in Parkinson’s Disease,"Final Report Project Summary: Exercise has increasingly garnered attention as an alternative treatment option for people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). We have observed that ice skating exercise has paradoxical persistence plus powerful neurotherapeutic potential for people living with PD. In this study, we examine one likely neuromechanical stimulus for this paradox; how familiar visual flow provides specific visual cues that subsequently provoke paradoxical ice skating skill. The goal of this experiment was to examine visual attention patterns of Parkinson’s patients while exposed to rapid visual flow in sport activity environments. Vision tracking in this experiment requires a stationary eye tracker and stimulus monitor. While PD and control participants observed still pictures and videos of ice skating, biking, and walking on the stimulus monitor, the eye tracker used an infrared light transmitter and receiver to determine the position, movement, and focus point for their eyes. Our objective was to determine if the visual flow of the videos (dynamic condition) provoked different visual cue attention and eye movements compared to viewing of the same scenes as still pictures (static condition). While viewing the skating videos, PD eye movements did not navigate the rink at random. There was regularity to the sequence of eye movements, following cyclic, somewhat regular scan-paths, and this was observed for both highly familiar and less familiar skaters. In contrast, eye movements while viewing still images of skating were more clustered, and less observant of different stimuli within the scene. This finding points to the merit of rapid visual flow activities, provoking skilled planning behaviour people living with PD. Visual stimuli within ice skating and biking contexts were encountered at a much faster pace compared to walking, and eye movements reflected this difference in pace. PD eye movements during viewing of skating and biking had greater amplitude spacing than during viewing of walking. This difference in saccade distance indicates that feed-forward attention behaviour of Parkinson patients increases with visual flow. Our results suggest that dynamic visual flow and/or vigorous sport participation may be a feasible neurotherapy for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Information about visually provocative contexts could be used to develop more effective exercise neurotherapies for people living with Parkinson’s disease.","Final Report Lay Summary: We used eye tracking to examine visual attention patterns of Parkinson patients while exposed to rapid visual flow in sport activity environments.

Jessica Naidu,,Jong Rho,Effect of Ketones in Mouse Model of Autism,"Final Report Project Summary: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by deficiencies in social interaction and communication, and restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour and activity. Atypical development and usage of language is a hallmark of ASD, but there are limited treatment options. Here, we investigated the effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by the BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD, which exhibits the core behaviours of the disorder. The KD is a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet, which has already been shown to reduce repetitive behaviours and improve social interactions in BTBR mice. USVs are whistle-like sounds that mice use as a form of communication, and studies have shown that both neonatal and adult BTBR mice emit USVs with different properties compared to C57BL/6J (B6) mice, a strain that has routinely served as a control in ASD- related studies. However, USVs emitted by adolescent BTBR mice have not been studied and the effects of the KD on USVs have not been evaluated in any rodent model of ASD. USVs were recorded by positioning an ultrasonic microphone approximately 20 centimetres above the cage and the Avisoft RECORDER software was used to collect the data. USVs between 60-200 kHz were recorded during male-female interaction for 5 min. The occurrence, duration, frequency, amplitude, types of calls, and call structure were analyzed. Results from adolescent animals showed that the KD dramatically increased the total number of USVs in the BTBR mice (~6-fold). The KD also normalized the average duration, maximum amplitude, maximum frequency, and amounts of two types of calls in these mice. Further analysis showed that USVs from adolescent B6 mice were mostly clustered into strings of calls separated by relatively long pauses, similar to previous data reported in neonatal mice. In contrast, USVs from BTBR mice showed only modest string organization, with a larger percentage of calls not associated with a string, and less total amount of strings and fewer calls per string emitted. After KD treatment, we found increases in the percentage of calls belonging to a string, the total number of strings emitted, and the average number of calls per string in the BTBR mice. Thus, the KD improved both the volume and structure of vocal communication in juvenile BTBR mice. In adult animals, the KD similarly increased the total number of USVs in the BTBR mice (~3-fold); yet, there was no significant improvement in average duration, maximum amplitude, or maximum frequency of the calls, suggesting that there may be an optimal age to administer the KD for optimum effects. Together, these data indicate that the KD can significantly ameliorate deficits in vocal communication in the BTBR model, suggesting that it could have therapeutic benefits for language impairment in ASD. Future studies to determine the expression levels of genes involved in language development may further reveal the mechanisms of the KD’s effects observed in the present study.","This project investigated the effects of the KD on ASD, examining its various features to identify potential benefits in a mouse model. During their exploration, they found that this diet enhances both the volume and structure of verbal communication.

Kyle Mayr,,Patrick Whelan,Trying to Manage Neuropathic Pain with Ketosis in Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Final Report Project Summary: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic event that effects 86,000 Canadians currently and is continually increasing every year. Physical therapy is one of the most effective ways to promote recovery following SCI but us usually accompanied by chronic pain in the form of neuropathic pain. Pain following SCI becomes a major deterrent in the desire to rehabilitate, forcing many patients to give up on treatment early. Currently, the primary treatment for neuropathic pain is the use of pharmacological opioids. Pharmaceutical use has many inherent issues due to the efficacy per patient, dependency on medications, and the accompanied undesired side effects. This presents a large issue in the clinic because patients are more likely to rehabilitate with pain suppression, but the adverse effects of these drugs may outweigh the reward. I believe that diet may play a large role in pain mediation and specifically, the ketogenic diet may play a large role in reduce perceived pain following spinal cord injury. Our preliminary data shows when isolated spinal cords were perfused in a solution of aCSF with ketone bodies there was an increased amount of dorsal root potentials. These potentials are inhibitory interactions with the spinal cord indicating an increase in inhibitory input into the sensory portion of the spinal cord, indicative of decreased pain signal transmission. Or lab found that when young mice were fed a ketogenic diet following a nerve injury, they did not develop a typical thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, characteristic of a neuropathic pain. In adult mice (C57B/L6) of 3 month of age, I found that they did not have significant differences in mechanical nociception of the hindpaws determined through von frey testing using the verified SUDO method. Furthermore, there was not a significant difference in thermal sensitivity by testing with hot plate test with 20 second removal protocol. Though neither test showed any differences in ketogenic diet vs pellet diet, I found that when animals were introduced to a novel open field, KD animals had reduced fast paced locomotor bouts ( >100mm/s) and reduced variability (smaller SD) compared to pellet fed animals. Furthermore, these animals did not express a change in center crossings. Taken together, this is indicative of lowered stress levels and may play a large role in the recovery following SCI. Though the mechanism is currently unknown, it is hypothesized that the ketogenic diet leads to the upregulation of the adenosine neuromodulator, which has been shown to elicit analgesic effects.","Final Report Lay Summary: Ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carb and reduced protein diet. Recently I have found that ketone bodies in the blood may play an important role in pain mediation and suppression. This study aims to elucidate whether a ketogenic diet may be beneficial in alleviating pain following spinal cord injury. This personalized diet may reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals needed for pain management following injury, therefore making rehabilitation a manageable experience, without the use of typical analgesics. Specifically, this study will focus on spinal cord injury as our previous data alludes to a beneficial role of ketones for motor recovery following injury.",,"Pain, Diet, Spinal, Ketogenic, Neuropathic",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Pain Perception,Ketogenic Diet,Nutrition,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2016,22000,22000,,,,,,,"22,000.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/the_effect_of_a_ketogentic_diet_to_manage_neuropathic_pain_in_spinal_cord_injury,,0,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=YweUFcMAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-mayr/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyle-Mayr,,,,,,,4,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,
Megan Lewis,,Quentin Pittman,The Effect of a Ketogenic Diet in comorbid Autism and Epilepsy,"Final Report Project Summary: Rationale Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently co-morbid with epilepsy indicating a common mechanistic link, although the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. To investigate treatments, we created a novel mouse model that concurrently exhibits hallmark features of both disorders. Objectives & Hypothesis Our objective is to utilize our novel mouse model of co-morbid ASD and epilepsy to investigate potential treatments. We hypothesize that the ketogenic diet may alter the ASD and epilepsy phenotype in our co-morbid mouse model. Methods The BTBR mice model behaviors of ASD; at postnatal day (P) 7 these mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline. Mice were tested behaviorally to validate the ASD phenotype and recorded chronically with video-EEG for epileptic activity. The ketogenic diet (KD; 6:1 ratio of fat to combined carbohydrate and protein) was then fed to the mice for a 2- week period starting at P45. The KD treated BTBR completed another battery of tests to investigate the effectiveness of the diet in this co-morbidity. Major findings We found that P7 LPS treated BTBR mice displayed decreased seizure thresholds and a conserved ASD phenotype. The video-EEG results indicated increased hippocampal and cortical electrographic discharges, which were time locked to freezing and myoclonic jerks. Following treatment with KD, BTBR mice displayed increased seizure thresholds and an altered ASD phenotype compared to controls. Implications for the field Early exposure to LPS in BTBR mice can reveal an underlying epileptic phenotype. Additionally, we have shown that the KD may be an effective treatment for co-morbid ASD and epilepsy.","Final Report Lay Summary: The Ketogenic Diet is a high fat diet that has been shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of neurological diseases. We are investigating why the ketogenic diet may be effective in treating autism spectrum disorder as well as epilepsy. Given that one-third of individuals with autism spectrum disorder concurrently have a epilepsy and many similarities exist in the development of these disorders, our research is focused on determining if this diet is particularly effective in a co-morbid state.",,"Mice, BTBR, Phenotype, Morbid","""Epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder""",y,Hippocampus,Ketogenic Diet,Nutrition,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2016,26500,26500,,,,,,,"26,500.00","26,500.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/the_effect_of_a_ketogenic_diet_in_comorbid_autism_and_epilepsy,,0,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=zMnua1oAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-lewis-06637a88/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Megan-Lewis-12,,Mount Royal University,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,

Recently, it has become clear that the period preceding conception (i.e. the preconception period) is also important in determining the developmental trajectory of offspring.

A subset of offspring were euthanized at weaning and in adulthood for brain analysis. Brains are analyzed for gross changes, such as thickness of the cortex, and for changes in neuron morphology and connectivity. Results indicate that offspring of preconception stressed dams have accelerated behavioral development compared to control offspring, although no changes in maternal care were observed. Stress offspring also show changes in relative brain size and cortical thickness.

Lane Liddle,,Fred (Frederick) Colbourne,The Effect of Cell Penetrating Peptides on Stroke,"Final Report Project Summary: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most deadly subtype of stroke, claiming approximately 50% of the lives of those afflicted. There are no current therapeutic nor clinical treatments for ICH. R18D is an arginine-rich peptide that is able to carry therapeutic cargo to the brain, and easily permeates the blood-brain barrier. R18D has been shown to improve outcomes after ischemic stroke and models of traumatic brain injury; given the overlap in mechanisms between ICH, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury, we hypothesized that R18D would be neuroprotective following ICH. Our study consisted of two phases to assess the safety and potential neuroprotection conferred by R18D, in the collagenase model of ICH in rats. First, we assessed the amount of bleeding (i.e., hematoma size) that followed administration of R18D, or vehicle 30 minutes after the induction of ICH. This comparison allowed us to determine whether R18D was safe to administer in our model of ICH . Phase one was a necessary first step to translation, because hematoma size is a key predictor of death and disability in patient populations- therefore, a drug that impacted bleeding would not be safe to administer to ICH patients. To assess hematoma size, we used a common spectrophotometric assay; results from phase one suggest that R18D did not significantly impact bleeding. In light of the results of phase one, phase two assessed whether early administration of R18D conferred behavioural and/or histological benefit. To assess this, we used sensitive measures to forelimb and hindlimb deficits in rats. These tasks are known as the Montoya staircase reaching tasks, and the horizontal ladder walking task, respectively. Histological benefit was assessed with a nissl stain, and a hemispheric volumes were compared as an indicator of overall cell death/atrophy. The histological results from this phase are still being analyzed. Behaviourally, R18D did not significantly improve performance on the staircase task, our most sensitive measure to striatal damage. Our interpretation of the horizontal ladder walking task will follow lesion volume assessment- due to blinding, treatment groups are not known. This study is the first to show arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides are safe to administer after intracerebral hemorrhage. Often, stroke researchers limit their findings regarding these molecules to models of ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury, and do not assess their potential beneficial impacts in models of ICH. Our study raises several questions related to timing and dosage parameters, which will be addressed in follow-up studies. As mentioned previously, hematoma size predicts death and disability in patient populations. Hemorrhagic transformation is a phenomenon that occurs in ischemic stroke populations, wherein the patient initially presents with an ischemic stroke that transforms into a hemorrhagic stroke when areas of the brain previously lacking blood flow are reperfused. If R18D has some efficacy as a neuroprotectant following ischemic stroke and does not impact bleeding, our results may be useful for those worried about hemorrhagic tranformation following ischemic stroke.",Final Report Lay Summary: CPPs are naturally occurring substances within our body that can offer protective benefits for the brain. This project examined if CPPs can improve the body’s natural recovery following ICH. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that CPPs are safe to administer following ICH.

Studies have used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as the mouse model of MS; however, a correlation between concentrations of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)/complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mixture and the severity of symptoms have not been established. Nine female mice were separated into three groups, each subcutaneously injected with 50 μl, 100 μl, or 150 μl of 1 mg/mL MOG solution to induce EAE. The behavioural test battery included open field exploration task, a skilled walking test, elevated plus maze, and Von Frey hair test. This study used a clinical symptom severity scale assessment to establish a correlation between symptoms severity and concentration of MOG/CFA. The study recorded baseline and post-induction measurements of skilled movement, anxiety-like symptoms, and mechanical nociception sensitivity. Over the course of eight weeks post-induction, all animals showed EAE progression. Although our findings showed no correlation between symptom severity and MOG/CFA mixture concentration, we had a 100% success rate with some multiphasic symptoms. We also found a correlation between behavioral symptoms and the severity of EAE. This pilot will set the stage for our future experiments.","This project proposes that stress may lead to a predisposition for MS. To investigate this relationship, they used mice with a condition called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to mimic MS in humans.

They did not find a clear connection between the amount of MOG and the severity of symptoms, however, they did observe that some symptoms appeared in a specific pattern. They also found a link between behavioral symptoms and MS severity. These results suggest that stress may be implicated in some symptoms of MS which motivates researchers to further explore this relationship.",,"Severity, Correlation, EAE, CFA","""Multiple Sclerosis, Stress""",n,Mylenation,MOG Solution,"Assessment, Symptomology",Animal,Basic,Mind and Body,University of Lethbridge,2016,7000,1375,,,,,,,"1,375.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-babatunde/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stella-Babatunde,,University of Calgary,Big Brothers Big Sisters of Calgary & Area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Janet Poplawski,,Gerlinde Metz,The Effects of Early Postnatal Stress on Health Outcomes Throughout Life,"Final Report Project Summary: The incidence of neurological and psychiatric disorders has risen sharply over the past decades, and evidence suggests that the onset and severity of these conditions of the brain are influenced by stress in early life. Early life stress (ES) is a particularly drastic influence on brain development, which modifies neuronal connectivity and biochemistry with lifelong consequences. The causal mechanisms of stress-induced adverse trajectories of brain development, mental and cognitive health, however, are poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that ES represents a critical determinant of brain development by modifying critical periods (CPs) of brain development. CPs during development have heightened sensitivity to internal and external experiences to allow formation of optimized neuronal connectivity and information processing. Thus, a CP of development helps to acquire specific, indispensable skills during a limited time window. Since CPs of brain development have been widely studied in the visual system, the primary visual cortex will serve as an ideal model system to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying ES-associated functional impairments. We induced perinatal stress by shipping lactating dams with their pups from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm on postnatal day (P)12. Behavioural tests included the assessment of visual acuity, sensorimotor and affective functions in groups of juvenile and adult offspring. Body weights and eye-opening observations were also recorded in offspring. Cortical thickness measurements and immunohistochemical staining for biological markers of development was performed on brains taken from adolescent mice. At P50, tissue collections were performed on a second set of animals for 1H NMR analysis. The resulting spectra were analysed for differences in metabolite concentrations between treatment groups. Our results indicate that early postnatal stress (1) increased behaviours indicative of anxiety, (2) decreased exploratory behaviours, (3) accelerated the functional and cellular development of the visual system, and (4) drastically altered the metabolism of stressed animals. These results provide novel insights into the perinatal origins of brain plasticity and life-long behavioural performance, and advance the understanding of why exposure to stress, drugs, and other toxicants early in life can result in impaired neurological and behavioural functions in human infants, children and adults. The impact of this project is increased by the comprehensive and thorough nature of the study (i.e., the inclusion of behavioural, morphological, volumetric, metabolic and stereological data). We are currently in the process of developing a comprehensive metabolic profile to predict stress-related disease vulnerability for both our human and animal cohorts.","Final Report Lay Summary: This project suggests that early life stress can significantly impact the trajectories of brain development, resulting in long-term impairments. Through the implementation of postnatal stress on a mouse model, the researchers observed increased anxiety behaviors, reduced exploratory behaviors, accelerated development of the visual system, and profound changes in metabolism. This study offers valuable insights into the origins of behavioral and neurological impairments during the postnatal period, while also providing a deeper understanding of the enduring damage caused by exposure to toxicants like early life stress.",,"Development, Stress, Behavioural, Neuronal, CPS",Stress,n,Post-natal Stress,,"Post-natal, Brain Development",Animal,Basic,"Mind and Body, Personalized Treatment",University of Lethbridge,2017,7000,2500,,,,,,,"2,500.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/janet-poplawski-91218514b,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Janet-Poplawski-2178850188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jacob Koudys,,Jodie Gawryluk,The Effect of Physical Activity on MS,"Final Report Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by neurodegeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. These neuronal markers are associated with a number of neuropsychological deficits (i.e., long-term memory, executive function, complex attention, processing speed, and efficiency of information processing) and decreased quality of life in individuals with MS. Though many individuals rely heavily on pharmaceuticals for management of cognitive and physical symptoms, exercise may be an effective intervention for improving cognition and quality of life, as well as slowing neurodegenerative progression. Evidence from previous neuroimaging studies on MS indicate there are measurable differences in both structural and functional brain circuitry associated with MS disease progression. We are in the process of implementing a 12-week structured walking program for 10 individuals with MS and comparing them to 10 matched controls with MS. Resting-state fMRI and DTI data will be collected from participants before and after the exercise intervention. We will also collect data on depressive symptoms and cognitive function using the Beck Depression Inventory, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Trails Making Test A and B, and Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward tests. We have three hypotheses: (a) the exercise group will show decreased normal-appearing white matter fractional anisotropy (NAWM-FA) and increased normal-appearing white matter mean diffusivity (NAWM-MD) compared to those in the no-treatment group; (b) the exercise group will show increased connectivity in the default mode network compared to the no-treatment group; and (c) the exercise group will score higher on measures of cognitive function and lower on depressive symptoms compared to the no-treatment group. Currently, no research has been published with pre- and post-MRI data in evaluation of an exercise intervention in MS. We hope to encourage increased consideration for the feasibility of exercise interventions in MS by evidencing measurable neural plasticity.",,,"Exercise, Group, Function, Intervention, Cognitive",Multiple Sclerosis,n,Neuroplasticity,"Exercise, Walking","Inflammation, Quality of Life",Human,"Basic, Translational, Clinical Trial","Personalized Treatment, Mind and Body",University of Victoria,2017,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/the_effect_of_physical_activity_on_ms,,0,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=lnunNUgAAAAJ,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacob-Koudys,https://clinicalneurosciences.ca/,University of Toronto (Scarborough),,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andrei Nastase,,Matthew Hill,Difference of the Sexes:  Endocannabinoids and Traumatic Memories,"Final Report Project Summary: The ability to clear emotionally aversive memories, a process referred to as fear extinction, is essential for recovery from stressful and traumatic events. Pathologically impaired fear extinction is thought to contribute to the development and persistence of psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD prevalence is twice as high in women as in men, with treatment efficacy also reflecting sex-differences. It has been shown that there is likewise a sex-difference in the presentation of fear behaviours among rodents. Males generally prefer to exhibit freezing behaviours, a passive fear coping response represented by the absence of movement except for respiration. Conversely, most females manifest darting behaviours, an active fear coping response characterized by rapid, forward, escape-like movements. The mechanisms underlying sex-differences in fear coping responses may involve the endocannabinoid (eCB) system. The eCB system is an endogenous signalling system known to play a significant role in the modulation of fear memory and fear coping strategies. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) in regulating fear memory extinction, as well as fear coping mechanisms, in male and female rats. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats underwent an auditory fear conditioning paradigm that trained the animals to associate a tone with an aversive footshock (conditioning). Twenty-four hours later - to explore the role of AEA in fear memory extinction dynamics - the animals were injected intraperitoneally with the AEA hydrolysis inhibitor URB597 (0.3 mg/kg), which increases AEA levels, one hour prior to being trained to extinguish the aversive tone- shock association memory by experiencing repeated presentations of the tone without co- presentation of the shock (extinction training). On the final day, the animals were tested for memory extinction recall by being presented again the tone alone without co-presentation of the shock (extinction retrieval). Sex differences were seen prominently in the conditioning phase, with males demonstrating significantly greater freezing than females, while females showed more frequent and a greater number of darts than males. During the extinction training and retrieval sessions, again, males showed greater freezing behaviour as compared to females. Interestingly, while URB597 administration did not affect fear memory expression in males, females given URB597 presented increased levels of freezing and diminished darting during early extinction training, comparable to those observed in males. These results help to further elucidate the mechanism by which the eCB system (in particular AEA) modulates fear memory and fear coping strategies and may help guide the development of sex-specific therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. Furthermore, this research provides a solid basis for further studies investigating eCB mediated sex-differences in fear memory and behaviour.","Final Report Lay Summary: All of us have bad memories, moments where we were really scared and frightened. Most of us are shaken up by these experiences, but eventually move on. People with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are thought to have a biological susceptibility that makes it more difficult for them to move on from traumatic experiences compared to other people. Since PTSD is fundamentally about fear-based memories, neuroscientists have been investigating how the brain learns and forgets about scary memories. Understanding this could hold the key to helping people recover from their PTSD.",,"Fear, Extinction, Memory, Males, Coping",PTSD,y,"Endocannabinoid, Memory",Cannabis,"Gender Difference, Memory",Animal,"Basic, Translational, Clinical Trial",Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2017,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/difference_of_the_sexes_endocanabinoid_and_traumatic_memories,,1,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=W9zlzK0AAAAJ,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Andrei-S-Nastase-2186486144,http://www.hill-lab.ca/sabin.html,University of Calgary,,,,andrei.nastase@ucalgary.ca,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,
Haley Vecchiarelli,,Matthew Hill,Colitis-Induced Alterations in Anxiety and Stress Regulation: Role of Cannabinoids and Neuroimmune Signalling,"Final Report Project Summary: It is well established that there is a large degree of comorbidities between inflammatory diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases, arthritis) and stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression). To date, however, the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities have not been fully elucidated. The endocannabinoid system regulates anxiety and inflammation, making it a potential candidate to investigate the mechanisms of these comorbidities. To examine the hypothesis that endocannabinoids may be involved in emotional comorbidities with peripheral inflammatory conditions, we employed an animal model of colitis to explore the potential role of endocannabinoids in this process. Colitis was induced by intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS, 0.45 mL, 50 mg/mL, 50 % [vol/vol] in ethanol/water) to adult male rats while control rats received the same volume of saline intracolonically. We previously showed, using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, that levels of anandamide (AEA) were decreased in the amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, at seven days after the induction of colitis. Furthermore, we show that colitis is associated with an increase in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, indicating that peripheral inflammation increases central AEA hydrolysis. Concomitantly with this, we also see an increase in anxiety like-behaviour in the elevated plus maze. We now show that this increase in anxiety can be reversed with an acute intracerebroventricular administration of an inhibitor (PF-04457845) of the enzyme, FAAH, which increases levels of AEA. Additionally, central administration of an antagonist (antalarmin) of the corticotrophin releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF-R1) throughout the duration of colitis reversed the AEA reductions in the amygdala and hippocampus, indicating that the reductions of AEA relevant for the generation of anxiety during colitis are regulated through a CRF-R1-driven increase in FAAH activity. Together these findings add to the understanding of central mechanisms underlying anxiety- like behaviours associated with peripheral inflammation. They suggest that similar to stress- induced anxiety, inflammation-induced decreases in AEA signaling (due to CRF driving FAAH activity), are relevant for the change in anxiety-like behaviours associated with inflammation.","Final Report Lay Summary: This study investigated how the endocannabinoid system is affected by chronic inflammatory diseases, such as colitis.

Sukhjinder Rehal,,Richard Dyck,Understanding Zinc’s Role in the Brain,"Final Report Project Summary: As you already know, my summer studentship was used as a technique mastering and pilot project phase for my honors thesis. Due to recent publications, my honors project changed directions, but still uses the same techniques I learned over summer. For this reason the project title and summaries will be different than previously described. Zinc is a molecule with numerous functions, including acting as a neuromodulator at synapses in some parts of the brain. Zinc transporter 3 (ZnT-3) is responsible for moving zinc into synaptic vesicles. Homozygous ZnT-3 knockout (KO) mice have no ZnT-3 while heterozygous (HT) mice have reduced levels when compared to the wild-type (WT) genotype. A reduction of ZnT-3 has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease pathology and an increased sensitivity to febrile seizures (Kambe et al., 2014). Maternal immune activation has been shown to promote an autism-like phenotype, including both behavioural deficits and cortical abnormalities in the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory cortex (Malkova et al., 2012; Shin Yim et al., 2017). We hypothesize that male offspring with reduced synaptic zinc will display reduced sociability and language capabilities, higher levels of compulsive behaviors, and cortical abnormalities in the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory cortex, if maternal immune activation had occurred. The severity of the symptomology is predicted to be gene dose-dependent, with lower synaptic zinc resulting in increased behavioural and neurological abnormalities. Male and female ZnT-3 heterozygous mice were used as breeding pairs, and the presence of a vaginal plug was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). On E12.5 mothers were injected with a single dose of 20 mg/kg of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (i) or equivalent volume of PBS vehicle (c). This resulted in six experimental groups; WTi, HTi, KOi, WTc, HTc, and KOc. Mice were tested at postnatal day 9 for ultrasonic vocalizations (UVSs) while being isolated from their mother and litter mates. USVs will be analyzed using MUPET, an open access MATLAB tool. At 10-12 weeks of age, mice will be tested behaviourally in the three chamber social test, marble burying test, open field test, prepulse inhibition test and self-grooming test. We will analyze behavioural data using ANOVA tests. After behavioural testing is complete, the mice will be sacrificed and the brains will be used in anatomical analysis. The anatomy of the primary somatosensory cortex will be examined using anti-rabbit-TBR1 and anti-mouse-SATB2, to identify the presence of cortical patches.","Final Report Lay Summary: Zinc is a nutrient that has many signaling properties within the brain, including the promotion of new neurons in a brain region called the hippocampus. This study seeks to see if a zinc rich diet can help increase the number of new neurons in the hippocampus, as a lack of new neurons in this region is associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease.

Asha Hollis,,Adam Kirton,Magnets for Movement,"Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation has become increasingly popular as a non-pharmacological, non-invasive neuromodulation therapy for children with cerebral palsy and lifelong disability secondary to perinatal brain injuries (1). Multiple randomized trials suggest techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve motor function in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke (2,3). Both of these techniques are known to facilitate natural plastic changes in the brain. However, a major limitation of these current brain stimulation approaches is difficulty in application to very young children and infants. For example, TMS may have low tolerability and/or feasibility due to the need for high levels of stimulation to evoke a motor response in younger children (4). As motor system neuroplasticity windows are maximal at these youngest ages (5), there is a pressing need to find alternative forms of non-invasive neuromodulation applicable to young children in order to optimize their outcomes. Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) offers a promising alternative. In tSMS, a strong permanent magnet is held over the skull to generate a static magnetic field within a functional cortical target such as the primary motor cortex (M1). Short-term application of tSMS has been shown to decrease resting motor cortex excitability in adults but neither the behavioural effects on motor learning nor application to the developing brain have been explored (6,7). We have previously shown that excitatory stimulation of the right M1 or inhibitory stimulation of the left M1 can enhance learning in the left hand (8). Therefore, if tSMS has a net inhibitory effect, application over the left M1 would be expected to enhance learning in the left hand. Furthermore, tSMS is even less invasive than TMS and tDCSs, and is not associated with the side-effects present with TMS/tDCS which are mild but may reduce tolerability (9). Thus, tSMS has important potential as a non-invasive brain stimulation tool for the youngest populations where impact may be largest. Our objective is to evaluate whether application of tSMS over the motor cortex of healthy school-aged children results in non-invasive modulation of cortical excitability and motor learning. Methods: This will be a randomized, sham-controlled, 3-arm, cross-over interventional trial. School-aged children between 8 and 18 years will be recruited through the Healthy Infants and Children Clinical Research Program (HICCUP). Inclusion criteria are informed consent/assent, absence of neuropsychiatric diagnoses, medications, or contraindications for brain stimulation. Potential participants with dental appliances, pacemakers, other contraindications for brain stimulation or pregnancy will be excluded. Based on relevant previous evidence, a sample size of 24 children will be recruited (n = 8/treatment arm). Procedures will take place at the Alberta Children's Hospital Pediatric Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Laboratory. The primary outcome will be change in score in the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), which has been shown to have high sensitivity in both healthy and disease motor learning populations. Participants will be computer-randomized into one of 3 groups to determine intervention sequence (e.g. left M1 tSMS in the first visit, right M1 tSMS in the second visit, and sham tSMS in the third visit). All participants will receive all interventions; the randomization determines the order in which they are received. Participants, parents and researchers will be blinded to the allocated intervention sequence. Participants will also be asked to guess if they received real or sham tSMS following each session. At baseline, neuronavigated (Brainsight2) TMS will be used to identify bilateral M1 ""hotspots"" (the location that consistently produces the greatest motor-evoked potentials). Baseline paired-pulse TMS neurophysiological measurements will include MEP amplitude, interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Following baseline clinical (PPT) and neurophysiological measurements, the tSMS magnet (S-45-30-N, Supermagnete) or an identical sham will be held on the skull directly above the navigated right M1 using a metal arm. Participants will perform 5 repetitions of the PPT every 5 minutes during 30 minutes of tSMS/sham application. Immediately following tSMS, the TMS neurophysiological measurements will be repeated. The PPT will be repeated after the TMS measurements are collected. Safety and tolerability questionnaires will be completed for both tSMS and TMS portions . During the second and third visits at two and four weeks respectively, the same procedures will be followed with random assignment to treatment group. Primary statistical analysis will use a linear mixed effects model with treatment group and time as explanatory variables and random effects for subjects at levels of within and between days to explore changes in performance and neurophysiology. Hypothesis: Our overall aim is to determine the effects of primary motor cortex tSMS on motor learning and M1 neurophysiology in typically developing children. Hypothesis 1: Short-term application of tSMS over the contralateral, left M1 will be associated with improved motor learning in the left hand as measured by the PPT. Hypothesis 2: Application of tSMS over either motor cortex (left or right) will be associated with a transient decrease in cortical excitability as measured by mean motor-evoked potential amplitude. Academic impact: Confirming the safety, feasibility, and actions of tSMS in children will open opportunities for clinical trials in cerebral palsy that include preschool-aged children. A simple, non-invasive method to modulate motor learning in the youngest hemiparetic patients brings the potential for home-based, personalized, neuromodulation therapy during optimal windows of developmental plasticity. Advancing such approaches in the ideal model of perinatal stroke could create new opportunities for the millions of children disabled by all forms of cerebral palsy.","Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a safe, painless way to potentially change brain function. NIBS is currently used for many conditions, including weakness following stroke, but nearly all studies have been in adults. Stroke also occurs in babies, causing lifelong disability for >10000 Canadian children. Such perinatal stroke typically leads to physical disabilities (cerebral palsy), though children's brains may be relatively good at adapting to such injuries. This neuroplasticity suggests children may be best suited for NIBS therapies. We have shown that NIBS can enhance movement function in children with cerebral palsy. However, technical complexity limits NIBS use in young infants and preschoolers who may have the best chance to benefit. A new, simple form of NIBS called transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) represents an appealing solution but has not yet been studied in children. tSMS in adults has demonstrated safety, tolerability and the desired effects on brain activity, though effects on motor function are not understood. Our study will determine if tSMS can improve motor learning in children. tSMS will target the motor cortex which is responsible for voluntary movement. Healthy children will be given either real or pretend (sham) tSMS while performing a motor task with their hand. We anticipate greater learning in those receiving tSMS. We will also measure activity of the motor cortex before and after tSMS using brain stimulation to better understand how tSMS works. If successful, tSMS could immediately be used in a clinical trial of young children with cerebral palsy. tSMS has the potential to become a safe, inexpensive, home-based way to enhance personalized rehabilitation for disabled children.",,"tsms, Motor, Children, Stimulation, Learning",Cerebral Palsy,n,Neuroplasticity,TMS,Pediatric,Human,Basic,"Tech, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2019,22000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/magnets_for_movement,,1,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Asha-Hollis-2175065189,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daphne Kaketsis,,Adam Kirton,"Before Neural Prosthetics, Kid's Played Video Games with their Brains","Background: Few circumstances are more tragic than an intellectually capable child being trapped in a body that does not work. Cerebral palsy (CP) causes most lifelong disability, affecting more than 50000 Canadian children and over 17 million people worldwide. There are estimated to be hundreds of Canadian children with severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy or other neurological conditions who are cognitively normal but physically locked-in. Brain computer interfaces (BCI) can change the very nature of such a challenging life. BCI can read information from the human cortex such as changes that occur in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during specific thoughts. Smart computer algorithms then learn to recognize the meaning within each signal and translate this information to control an effector device such as a computer cursor on a screen. Such “mind control” is now reality but has typically been highly complex, including the need for invasive surgery, implanted sensors and complicated technology. However, BCI are rapidly advancing toward user-friendly systems that could be more easily used by families in the community, facilitating real life applications. A major gap exists between innovators of these technologies and the families of affected children and the clinicians who care for them. Rapidly narrowing this gap are emerging, simpler, and inexpensive technologies that could move BCI from advanced labs into the hands of clinicians, therapists and even families for home use. This in turn requires new initiatives to generate child-friendly training systems that could deliver large doses of experience (e.g. video games) that could be translated into practical skills required for independence (e.g. operating a computer or wheelchair). We have recently demonstrated that school-age children, both typically developing and those with cerebral palsy secondary to neonatal brain injury, can quickly learn to control simple EEG-based BCI systems. Methods: This is a prospective, interventional pilot study. Participants will be children with severe neurological disability and preserved cognition, and their families. This population in Calgary has already been identified through active surveillance by relevant clinician specialists at the Alberta Children’s Hospital. Qualification criteria include (1) severe quadriplegia with minimal or no functional use of the hands (GMFCS level 5, MACS level 5), (2) estimated developmental cognitive capacity of 6 years (grade 1) or older, (3) near normal extraocular movements, hearing, and afferent visual function, and (4) informed consent/assent. By the time of this study, 10-12 families will be participating in the BCI Training Program, attending the recently established ACH BCI Laboratory on a weekly basis during which the following training will be advanced. We will employ an advanced EEG-based system from g.tec not previously studied in children. Enriched EEG data combined with more sophisticated computer analysis and algorithms allows execution of more advanced BCI paradigms. Specifically, this study will use a well-established P300 technique where a participant’s attention to specific areas on a screen is combined with intermittent flashing lights on these targets to generate a unique EEG potential that is then detected and transformed into an intended action. We have recently acquired novel software that allows us to overlay this P300 controller onto a gaming screen on a single large monitor. This project will involve the design and testing of different games and game controller options using the g.tec P300 BCI. Options for different video game types (e.g. strategy versus action) will be explored choosing suitable games based on developmental level and patient/parent preference. Different options for creating interfaces between existing games and BCI control will be developed. Unique gaming strategies will be advanced based on computer science expertise, child and family input, and translatability to real world applications. The primary outcome will be the subjective ratings of success as reported by the participant and their parent. This will be measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) where participants set their own goals and then rank their performance and satisfaction (10 points scale) at set follow-ups (weekly). Secondary outcomes include performance success on instructed tasks (Cohen’s Kappa), a tolerability measure, and family narratives. As a personalized pilot study of individual patients and families, analysis will be primarily descriptive. Hypothesis: Our overall aim is to create a BCI training program for severely disabled children. In order to achieve this, we first need to develop child-friendly BCI gaming systems to both engage children and families, and advance training options. The primary aim of this specific project is to construct, test, and translate a video-game based BCI training program for children with severe neuromotor impairment. Our research question is to determine if commercially available videogames can be integrated with user-friendly BCI systems to allow severely disabled children to play the game independently or with assistance. We hypothesize that most children with severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy can achieve an assisted level of game performance that results in subjective personal enjoyment and satisfaction. Academic impact: This work will eventually enhance function in severely disabled children. Recent evidence suggests BCI learning can be enhanced with the non-invasive brain stimulation technologies we are currently advancing in perinatal stroke12. We are uniquely positioned to lead the emerging field of BCI applications in stroke and cerebral palsy. For the first time, there is real hope of restoring meaningful function to children with severe hemiparesis and reducing the lifelong burden it places on their quality of life, family, and future potential.","This project will directly advance our efforts to build a child-centered brain-computer-interface program to help severely disabled young people do things they never thought they would. Our recent experience highlights this project's potential. In the last 6-months, with no past experience, and with a commercially available, inexpensive brain-computer-interface product we purchased online for $300, we have helped 4 locked-in (smart but physically incapable of moving) young people experience things they thought were impossible. This included an 8 year old boy driving a remote control car, and a 9 year old boy playing a video game for the first time in their lives. The pure joy expressed by the children and their parents was immeasurable, and is the primary motivator to advance this work.",,"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), Children, Training, EEG, Game",Cerebral Palsy,n,Neuroplasticity,Brain Computer Interface,Pediatric,Human,Translational,"Tech, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2018,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/before_neural_prosthetics,,1,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daphne-kaketsis-m-sc-e-i-t-91b961135/,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Daphne-A-Kaketsis-2198525269,,,ENA2 Innovative Consulting Inc,,,dkaketsis@ena2.com,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Claire Donnici,,Catherine Lebel,Mom's Mental Health Influences on Pre-Birth Brain Development,"Background: Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety are more common in women during pregnancy and are linked to negative behavioural and cognitive outcomes in their children(1,2). Anxiety specifically, is experienced by 15.6% of women during pregnancy(3). Perinatal maternal anxiety is correlated with attention regulation, learning deficits, emotional problems, externalizing and internalizing behaviours, and psychological disorders in children(4–7). In addition, associations between cognition and perinatal anxiety have been observed in children, namely toddlers, and adolescents born to mothers who experienced perinatal anxiety(8,9). These children and adolescents score lower on development indexes, and cognitive measures respectively(8,9). While relatively little literature has investigated the neurological underpinnings of these behavioural and cognitive problems, the limbic system is most commonly implicated(10–13). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been used in imaging studies in an attempt to observe the association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy, and structure and function in children’s brains. A few MRI studies suggest a relationship between perinatal maternal anxiety and reductions in cortical thickness and/or white matter microstructure in children’s brains(10-13). Gray matter reductions were observed in various locations including temporal, frontal and/or limbic regions(10-13). These studies all present valuable findings, but mainly focus on infants as opposed to pre-school aged children or older(10-12). Pre-school aged children are an important age range to study because the preschool years represent a period of extensive brain development including anatomical and physiological change, and great behavioural and cognitive growth(14). Because infants have previously been the study population of choice, there is a gap in the current understanding of the long-term effects of prenatal anxiety on child brain development. The objective of the project is to determine associations between prenatal anxiety and children’s brain structure during the preschool period. Methods: MRI data has been previously collected on 102 children aged 2-6 years (57m/45f). Children were scanned on a GE 3T MR750w scanner using T1-weighted imaging (for anatomical measures of volume and thickness) and diffusion tensor imaging (for measures of white matter structure). Participants were recruited from a prospective study that recruited women during pregnancy. Prenatal anxiety was measured during each trimester of pregnancy using the Generalized Anxiety Scores from the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). Imaging data will be quality-checked and processed to provide measures of diffusion anisotropy, cortical thickness, and brain volumes. Brain images will be analyzed using FreeSurfer and FSL software, and correlated with maternal anxiety scores during each trimester of pregnancy, using SPSS. Potential cofounding variables (sex, age, birthweight, gestational age at birth) will be included as covariates in the analysis. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that brain structure in the limbic system will have the strongest associations with maternal anxiety levels, as it is the area of the brain responsible for emotional control and behaviour. We also expect to observe associations between maternal anxiety and higher order cortical regions such as the prefrontal cortex and temporal association areas, since these areas are undergoing large developmental changes during the preschool period(14). Academic impact: This research will further our understanding of the relationship between maternal mental health in pregnancy and children’s brain outcomes. The few MRI studies that have examined associations between maternal anxiety and brain structure and function in children have primarily focused on infants(10-12). The findings of this study will bring a unique perspective to the forefront through addressing the lasting effects of prenatal anxiety in children observed during the preschool period, a critical period of brain development(14). The focus on prenatal anxiety as opposed to perinatal anxiety also differentiates this project from current research. The findings will highlight the prenatal periods during which children’s brains may be most susceptible to the effects of anxiety, informing future treatment for pregnant women. MRI studies that have previously explored connections between perinatal anxiety and neonates have discovered a range of changes in brain structure including reductions either in cortical thickness and/or white matter microstructure(10-13). Reductions in gray matter have also been observed, but there has been a lack of agreement in findings as to the location of the reductions. Findings vary between gray matter reduction in frontal, temporal and limbic regions(10-13). The present study will add to knowledge on where changes are observed, and address critical differences in brain structure that may have not previously been discovered. This project provides a foundation from which future research can investigate possible treatments and interventions to support optimal brain development in children.","Anxiety in women during and after pregnancy is linked to behavioural and learning problems in their children. However, the underlying brain differences in children whose mothers experienced anxiety in pregnancy are unclear. This study will examine brain structure in preschool-aged children born to mothers who experienced anxiety during pregnancy. The pre-school period is a time of great brain growth and development, and it is when behaviour and learning problems are often first recognized. Anxiety scores were collected from mothers during pregnancy, and brain imaging data has been collected on their children. The project will investigate associations between mothers’ anxiety and children’s brain structure. In addition to identifying the lasting effects of prenatal anxiety, the results of the project will provide a baseline from which to investigate treatments and interventions for children, and may suggest the importance of offering women with prenatal anxiety treatment options during pregnancy. This research will encourage prenatal mental health to be a greater area of conversation for women and health care providers.",,"Anxiety, Children, Maternal, Pregnancy",Anxiety,y,Brain Development,Stress Management,"Pediatric, Treatment, Intervention",Human,"Basic, Translational",Mind and Body,University of Calgary,2018,"8,000.00","2,000.00",,,,,,,"2,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/mom_s_mental_health_influences_on_pre_birth_brain_development,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Claire-Donnici-2185592663,,University of Calgary,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,
Julie Joyce,,Chantel Debert,The Eyes are a Window to the Brain,"Background: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most commonly occurring injuries across the globe ranging from 280 per 100 000 in adults, to over 1000 per 100 000 in younger children [1,2]. A majority of patients with moderate to severe TBI have symptoms and functional limitations that persist and require rehabilitation [3]. Although exciting advances in acute treatment of TBI are being made, patients make significant gains towards returning to function and participating in meaningful activities through rehabilitation. In recent years important technological advances have been made in the field of TBI rehabilitation both for assessment and treatment, yet few have been evaluated in the adult TBI population. The need exists for improved assessment and management of these patients to promote recovery and hasten return to function. High quality intervention studies are also urgently needed. Vestibular-ocular system deficits are common following a TBI injury [4-8]. Currently there is no ‘gold standard’ method of assessment and treatment of TBI-induced vestibular-ocular deficits. Due to limitations of current assessment techniques, these deficits often go unnoticed by clinicians. This study, a transnational collaborative research program, aims to bring together international experts in TBI rehabilitation to evaluate the use of technology in the assessment and rehabilitation of individuals with TBI who suffer with vestibular-ocular deficits. This research study is important for several reasons. Firstly, despite the heterogeneity in the severity of injuries, in moderate to severe TBI, deficits to the visual and vestibular systems are common. Visual function incorporates widespread central nervous system areas which makes it vulnerable to the diffuse nature of damage sustained after a TBI [9]. A better understanding of visual and vestibular dysfunction following injury could provide clinicians with tools with which to orient their interventions to address specific patient needs. Secondly, most visual and vestibular deficit assessments have been clinical in nature. The lack of precision of some of the clinical measures used in these assessments makes it difficult to truly understand the nature of the problems, which in turn prevents the development of targeted rehabilitation interventions. Newer technological assessment techniques, such as computerized dynamic visual acuity testing or the quantified Head Impulse Test, allow for more precise quantification of deficits. Pilot work with individuals with and without TBI shows that these approaches could be powerful and effective interventions for this population [10,11]. There is an urgent need to translate these new developments into clinical rehabilitation. Methods: Study overview: This is a transnational study with research centres in France, Israel, Montreal, and Calgary. I will be working specifically with patients at Foothills Medical Centre (FMC) who have suffered a moderate to severe TBI. We will be conducting a proof of concept clinical trial that will encompass an evaluation of current and experimental vestibular-ocular assessment techniques and rehabilitation approaches. Participants: 16 TBI patients with vestibular and/or ocular deficits will be recruited. Inclusion criteria includes individuals 16-40 years of age, that have suffered a moderate-severe TBI and have been admitted to the inpatient neurorehabilitation unit at FMC. Participants are required to tolerate one hour/day of vestibular and vision therapy. Initial screening: TBI is a heterogeneous injury. A thorough initial screen to identify other clinical findings and co- existent diagnoses will occur for all participants to ensure that all relevant comorbid conditions are identified. A Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI) will also be administered. Clinical assessments: We will use the procedures described in the Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS) for Concussion module to assess ocular impairment. Additionally, we will administer the King-Devick Test which measures impaired eye movements and other correlates of suboptimal brain function. We will be conducting the Head Thrust Test which has been used to identify individuals with peripheral vestibular hypofunction. Technological assessments: Tobii Pro Eyeglasses 2 will be used to assess visual performance. These glasses enable participants to explore their visual environment while four cameras track the corneal reflections of their eyes. Computerized Dynamic Visual Acuity will be measured using a NeuroCom InVision System. The Impulse Test, which uses accelerometers and cameras, combined with rapid computerized pupil tracking software to examine the vestibulo-ocular reflex, will also be conducted. Experimental rehabilitation: The intervention will be an individualized impairment-based program and will include gaze stabilization exercises, substitution exercises, and oculomotor exercises. I will have an active role in developing and implementing patient-specific treatment plans. Experimental Protocol: All eligible participants will be randomized to either standard of care or standard of care + personalized vestibular and vision rehabilitation program. Participants will be monitored weekly to assess for adverse effects, improvement in symptoms and treatment exercises. The selected participants will engage in a 6-week trial of rehabilitation. At the end of the intervention both groups will repeat the screening, clinical and technological assessments. After 3 months post-rehabilitation the screening, clinical and technological assessments will be repeated for all participants. Hypothesis: Hypothesis I: The use of technology-based visual and vestibular assessments in addition to current clinical evaluation of TBI patients will improve clinicians’ abilities to detect TBI-induced vestibular and visual deficits and will allow clinicians to develop personalized rehabilitation protocols. Aim I: There will be a 50% greater detection rate of vision and vestibular deficits in patients with moderate to severe TBI with technology-based visual and vestibular tools compared to clinical assessment alone. Hypothesis II: The complementary use of technology in visual and vestibular rehabilitation approaches will improve TBI patient outcomes immediately and at 3 months post-rehabilitation. Aim II: Patients with moderate to severe TBI that engage in the personalized vestibular and visual therapy rehabilitation will have a significantly improved quality of life (based on the Quality of Life after Brain Injury questionnaire (QOLIBRI) compared to those patients with moderate to severe TBI receiving standard of care alone. Academic impact: To date, there are no clinical assessment tools that accurately assess vestibular and ocular deficits in moderate to severe TBI. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the utility of more advanced technology in the assessment of these deficits following TBI. A gap in the literature exists in how we choose to measure early post-traumatic alterations in vision, vestibular function and visual perception, as well as in our understanding of the complex interaction between these systems. This study aims to explore more accurate diagnostic methods to diagnose visual and vestibular dysfunction following moderate to severe TBI. As well, no solid evidence-based treatment approaches are available for treatment of visual or vestibular deficits in moderate to severe TBI populations. Vestibular rehabilitation is now well recognized to treat individuals with vestibular dysfunctions and we have reports of its use with the mild TBI population with some success [7], however few studies have explored the benefits in moderate to severe TBI. Further, no studies to date have explored the utility of a personalized vision therapy program in patients with moderate to severe TBI. The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of the best tools to use in the assessment of oculomotor, vestibular and visual perception deficits after TBI, as well as to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of rehabilitative strategies addressing the identified deficits. We contend that assessment and rehabilitation of the vestibular and visual systems could conceivably occur in moderate to severe TBI, in multiple practice settings, and improve patient quality of life.","The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020 traumatic brain injuries (TBI) will be the most common cause of death and persistent injuries world-wide [12]. Dizziness, difficulty with balance (also called vestibular deficits) and vision problems are common symptoms that will occur following TBI. Many people can recover in the initial weeks following injury, but in some cases symptoms will persist and causes significant impairments in the ability of the patients to live independently or return to work and leisure activities. There is limited research evaluating the effectiveness of treatment for vision and dizziness in TBI. Thus, the aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate diagnostic tools that use new cutting-edge technology for individuals with vision and vestibular deficits that persist following moderate to severe TBI. 2) Evaluate innovative and personalized treatment protocols in patients with TBI that have vision and vestibular problems to see if these treatments improve quality of life and symptoms. This study will include 16 adults who have sustained a moderate to severe TBI. An initial evaluative phase using the best available technology to evaluate vision and vestibular dysfunction will be performed, and results compared with typical clinical tests currently used. If symptoms and functional problems are evident, participants will be randomly placed into a treatment group (with exercises for eye movement, inner ear-eye reflex and attention) or a control group (with current rehabilitation techniques). We will measure success in terms of improved symptoms and quality of life following a 6-week treatment intervention. We will also evaluate whether the benefits of the treatment protocol persist at 3 months following treatment. It is expected that this study will inform clinical practice and future research leading to a more effective treatment program for TBI that includes multiple components. Ultimately, this program will lead to better health care delivery and decreased public health burden from TBI.",,"TBI, Vestibular, Rehabilitation, Deficits, Ocular",Traumatic Brain Injury,n,Neuroplaticity,Eye Movement Exercises,"Treatement, Symptom Management",Human,"Basic, Translational","Tech, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2018,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/the_eyes_are_a_window_to_the_brain,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie-Joyce,,Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,1?,,,

Chris Duszynski,,Jeff Dunn,Does My Brain Say its Safe to Play Sports Again?,"Background: It is estimated that as many as 1 in 3 Canadians suffer a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) before the age of 25[1]. Symptoms include cognitive deficit, somatic sensitivity, and headaches, among others. In many cases, symptoms resolve within days, however, a subset of the population (10-30%) suffer post-concussion symptoms for weeks to months[2,3]. Quantitative tools are needed to assess injury severity, detect treatment response, and inform “return to activity”. Common imaging techniques such as X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are unable to detect structural abnormality following concussion or mTBI. Recently, advanced MRI has been sensitive to subtle disturbances in brain function and structure following concussion, however, these advanced MRI scans are expensive and generally unavailable for use in clinics and athletic facilities. To address the lack of concussion imaging tools, we aim to develop a wearable technology for imaging brain function, with light. This research will utilize a novel technology called Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to probe brain activity by measuring patterns of blood flow and oxygen delivery[4]. In specific, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the brain absorb light at specific wavelengths; the same wavelengths of light are not absorbed by most of the biological tissue in skin, bone, and brain (predominantly water, lipids, and collagen)[5]. Therefore, by shining light into the brain, and measuring the absorption and scattering of the light that returns, we directly measure changes in blood flow and oxygenation[6]. Blood oxygenation is tightly coupled to neuronal activity through a process called neurovascular coupling, which in turn allows us to indirectly measure local brain activity by measuring changes in local blood oxygenation[7]. The biomechanical forces of a concussion injury often cause small micro-tears on the long fiber tracts or “wires” that connect one hemisphere of the brain to the other. Small micro-tears on these long neuron pathways are not typically visible on CT or MRI brain images, yet can cause disrupted communication between the two hemispheres, resulting in cognitive and somatic symptoms[8]. The method we are developing quantifies cross-hemisphere communication by measuring the coherence of brain activity between the two hemispheres of the brain. fNIRS machines are small and inexpensive in comparison to MRI and CT, making fNIRS an advantageous technology for use in clinics and athletic facilities. The goal of this research is to develop a portable and non-invasive tool for quantifying concussion injury severity and managing recovery. Methods: Patient Recruitment: Since it is likely that pediatric and adult populations have different post-concussion progression[9] this project will undertake studies in both populations. Pediatric patients are recruited from the Calgary Childhood Traumatic Brain Injury Program at the Alberta Children’s Hospital, under the supervision of Dr. Keith Yeates. Adult patients are recruited from the Foothills Hospital Brain Injury Rehabilitation clinic, under the supervision of Dr. Chantel Debert. We will collect 40 patients in each cohort (adult and pediatric). We believe this is an attainable number for the length of this project, based on our current recruitment program. This sample will give us >90% power to investigate coherence differences while controlling for age and sex, as these characteristics may impact outcome[10]. This power calculation is based on data from our previous pediatric and adult pilot studies, from which it was determined that 20 concussion subjects are required to detect a significant (p<0.05) difference in coherence. Data Acquisition: To determine the sensitivity of fNIRS coherence we will investigate specific brain regions during task, as well as at rest. We have developed a lightweight head cap with light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiode detectors that continuously records oxygenation from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the primary motor cortex (PMC), which are involved in cognition and sensorimotor activity, respectively. We have implemented a cognitive working memory task (visuospatial n-back), and a sensorimotor exercise (finger-tapping), along with a 300 second rest period. The entire acquisition is approximately 13 minutes. Because this is a portable technology, we will scan patients right in the clinic, and control subjects in our laboratory. Data Analysis: Coherence can be described as the covariance between two signals’ frequency spectra, with 1 being absolute coherence and 0 being absolute incoherence. Inter-hemispheric coherence is determined by calculating the coherence of activity recorded from bilateral regions across time, and provides a measure of neuronal communication, otherwise known as functional connectivity, between those regions[11]. I have developed a custom processing and analysis pipeline in Matlab[12] that utilizes a wavelet transform method to investigate coherence as a function of both time and frequency[13]. Statistics: A mixed-design Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will test for coherence difference between groups (fixed effect), and for task-effect. A linear regression will determine if fNIRS coherence is associated with clinical outcome scores. Multiple corrections will be corrected using the Hochberg-benjamini method, which is a moderately conservative method. Hypothesis: Aims: 1) Develop a processing and analysis pipeline for measuring fNIRS coherence in concussion patients. 2) Investigate whether fNIRS coherence is sensitive to concussion injury, and determine if task increases sensitivity. 3) Determine if fNIRS coherence is associated with symptom burden and clinical outcome in concussion patients. 4) Determine if fNIRS coherence is sensitive to treatment and recovery. Hypothesis: We have published two pilot studies in the Journal of Neurotrauma with evidence that fNIRS coherence, as a measure of inter-hemispheric communication, is sensitive to injury in adults[14] and children with persistent concussion symptoms, particularly during task. As part of this research project I have developed and implemented a more advanced coherence analysis method that we hypothesize will improve our ability to detect concussion injury. We hypothesize that cognitive and sensorimotor tasks will increase the sensitivity of fNIRS inter-hemispheric coherence to injury in adults and children with post-concussion symptoms. We hypothesize that reduced coherence will be associated with worse symptom burden early in recovery, and that fNIRS coherence values measured over time will correlate with patient recovery. This important clinical research will determine if fNIRS can be used as a novel and quantitative measure of concussion injury and recovery. Academic impact: To our knowledge, our group is the only one in the world developing this specific combination of acquisition technology and processing methods to assess injury after concussion and we are the only group with published evidence of this method in the concussion population. The focus of this research grant is to develop a tool that is ready for clinical application. Three research priorities have been identified to determine the efficacy of this technology for clinical application, and will be addressed in this stage of clinical investigation. In this stage we will 1) optimize the method, 2) understand the effect of region and task on coherence in this population, and 3) characterize the relationship between fNIRS coherence and clinical outcome. The aims of this proposal directly parallel these research priorities, highlighting our strategic path from innovation to impact. We have a unique and novel technology for measuring brain function, that is showing great promise for differentiating concussion from controls. A wearable neuroimaging technology that is sensitive to concussion injury would significantly improve the management of concussion patients in two ways. First, if there is an association between fNIRS coherence and concussion symptomology, as suggested in our pilot study, this technology could help a physician accurately diagnose the injury and get that patient the appropriate care earlier in recovery. This is particularly important in light of recent research showing that cervical neck injury as a result of a concussive event can actually mimic a brain injury, and is often misdiagnosed as such. Patients with a brain injury versus patients with a cervical neck injury should be managed differently. This technology may improve diagnostic accuracy and lead to a personalized medicine approach to treatment and recovery. Secondly, novel treatments are showing promise in treating patients with persistent symptoms, however, there is a lack of tools to evaluate the effect of these treatments. Advanced MRI is too expensive to track treatment and recovery across multiple time points. On the other hand, fNIRS is relatively inexpensive and accessible in a variety of environments, making it an excellent tool for tracking recovery and monitoring treatment in small clinics and athletic facilities. I have an excellent training environment, with a strong interdisciplinary network of researchers who we collaborate with. We have collaborations with physicians specialized in pediatrics, neurology, and brain injury rehabilitation, and research scientists specialized in psychology, neuroimaging, and brain physiology. These collaborations exist at three sites, namely, the Foothills Hospital, the Alberta Children’s Hospital, and Roger Jackson Sports Medicine center. In Calgary we have a world class concussion program called the Calgary Integrated Concussion Research Program, which strengthens our research program through monthly meetings and collaborations with researchers from several different faculties. Specifically, we have added specialists in adult (Dr. Chantel Debert) and pediatric (Dr. Keith Yeates & Dr. Brian Brooks) brain injury outcomes to inform the translation of this research to the clinic (knowledge translation). Further, this research will be disseminated in the form of manuscripts in respected academic journals, and at international research meetings such as the Society of fNIRS in Tokyo (October 2018) and Canadian Society of Neurotrauma (TBD).","Currently there are no accepted imaging methods for concussion assessment. Our group aims to fill this void by developing a novel technology that uses light to measure the severity of damage following a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. This technology is portable, non-invasive, and relatively inexpensive in comparison to other imaging methods like MRI or CT. A concussive injury can cause small micro-tears on the long fiber tracts or “wires” that connect one hemisphere of the brain to the other. Small micro-tears on these long “communication” pathways are not typically visible on CT or MRI brain images, yet can disrupt communication between the two hemispheres and lead to cognitive and somatic symptoms. Our novel technology measures the cross-brain communication by recording activity on both sides of the brain, and calculating the similarity of brain activity across time. Our preliminary evidence suggests that this novel technology is sensitive to reduced brain communication in patients who have suffered a concussion or brain injury.",,"Coherence, Brain, Injury, fNIRS, Techology","""Concussion, TBI""",n,Blood Oxygenation,Biomarker,Assessment,Human,Translational,"Tech, Personalized Treatment",University of Calgary,2018,26500,26500,,,,,,,"26,500.00","26,500.00","PhD, Graduate",Graduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/does_my_brain_say_its_safe_to_play_sports_again,,1,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-duszynski-4757b163/,,,,Cicle Cardiovascular Imaging,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Colleen Lacey,,Jodie Gawryluk,Are you Ready Boots? Start Walking (for MS)!,"Background: Canada has the highest prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS); with 100 000 Canadians diagnosed with MS, we have a rate that is nine times higher than the global average. MS is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by white matter degeneration. Given that the lesions associated with MS can be distributed throughout the central nervous system, individuals with MS may experience changes in sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning. Up to 70% of individuals with MS experience impairments in multiple cognitive domains, such as information processing, episodic memory recall, and executive function. Other symptoms of MS include decreased quality of life, fatigue, depressed mood, and decreased fitness. Most individuals with MS are diagnosed in young adulthood and given that there is no cure, the majority rely on pharmaceuticals for long-term medical management at high cost ($20 000-$40 000/year) and variable results. Exercise as an intervention strategy has shown promise in managing other types of neurological disorders including stroke, dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Newly emerging research investigating the relationship between MS symptoms and exercise has demonstrated positive effects on symptom management, however neurophysiological evidence has not yet supplemented these claims. Along these lines, Ms. Laureen Harrison, a co-lead on this project, reported MS-related fatigue that left her bedridden for years, until she began an exercise program that changed her life. Furthermore, our group recently found that individuals with MS that reported exercising more frequently, also endorsed fewer depressive symptoms, were less challenged by fatigue, and experienced fewer self- reported cognitive concerns. It has been hypothesized that exercise may protect the brain from the neurodegenerative progression of MS. However, changes in brain structure and cognition have not been well investigated. The fundamental questions that the current study proposes to examine are as follows: Is there objective brain based evidence that exercise has neuroprotective effects in individuals with MS? How does the improvement in symptoms (such as improvements in cognition, and quality of life and decreases in depression and fatigue) relate to changes in the brain? The use of neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to examine the effect of exercise on the brain of individuals with MS is an identified gap in the literature. We aim to fill this gap by building on previous literature and incorporating new neuroimaging techniques and exercise monitoring technologies. Methods: This study will use DTI to examine 15 individuals with MS before and after a 12-week walking exercise intervention (based on Sandroff et al., 2016) compared to 15 age and sex matched individuals with MS who receive typical care. Participants are asked to complete the exercise three times spaced throughout the week for 12 weeks in a convenient location of their choice. FitBits are provided for both the participants and researchers to keep a track of the activity. Furthermore, the study will examine the relationship between changes in symptoms that result from exercise (including changes in cognition, depression, fatigue and quality of life) using well validated neuropsychological test batteries and tracking white matter changes in the brain with DTI. DTI is a type of MRI-based analysis that is non- invasive, easily repeatable, and a widely available technique that allows for the examination of brain structure and function. DTI measures water diffusion in the brain to provide indices of white matter integrity. This measure is essential for indicating normal versus unhealthy neural communication between brain regions and is thus an ideal means of investigating the neuroprotective effects of exercise on individuals who have MS. Hypothesis: It is expected that individuals in the exercise intervention will show post treatment improvements in symptoms (ie. improvement on neuropsychological tests, reduced depression scores and increased quality of life scores) that are associated with improvements in white matter integrity when compared to the control group. It is also hypothesized that the MS individuals in the exercise intervention group will show greater integrity of white matter tissue than the non-exercise group and from initial baseline testing. Academic impact: There is currently a distinct lack of published neuroimaging studies on pre- and post- exercise interventions in MS- this will be the first! The proposed study has the potential to change the first-line intervention for individuals with MS. If there is evidence that exercise leads to changes in brain structure for individuals with MS, the subsequent studies and associated knowledge translation could ensure that patients with MS are encouraged to exercise as part of rehabilitation (thereby providing a no-cost, evidence-based intervention). The results of this study have the potential to stimulate future research in many ways; including investigating other types of exercise, neuroimaging modalities, and useful exercise-monitoring technologies, building better treatment plans for these individuals. The ultimate goal is to help individuals with MS to build a better quality of life, for instance with reduced fatigue and depression, and increased cognitive function by protecting the brain from the degenerative effects of MS through exercise. This research has the ability to change lives of individuals with MS across Canada and beyond.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a brain disorder that is associated with a wide range of symptoms, including diminished cognitive function, emotional dysregulation and fatigue. Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS to date. Nonetheless, recent evidence shows that exercise may have positive effects on symptoms and disease progression. The problem is that there is a lack of research on how exercise affects the brain in MS. The goal of the current research is to examine brain structure/function and symptoms in a group of patients with MS before and after a weekly exercise intervention. This study could have significant implications for the management of MS symptoms and overall improved quality of life.",,"Exercise, Fatigue, Intervention, White Matter, Depression",Multiple Sclerosis,n,Cognition,Exercise,Symptom Management,Human,Clinical Trial,Mind and Body,University of Victoria,2018,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/are_you_ready_boots_start_walking_for_ms,,1,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=ZWquI3cAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-lacey-28192a167/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Colleen-Lacey-2161206553,,University of Victoria,,,,clacey@uvic.ca,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raven Yip,,Jong Rho,Could the Ketogenic Diet help Treat Fragile X Syndrome?,"Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG trinucleotide expansion greater than 200 repeats in the 5’ untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene (1). This mutation results in hypermethylation of Fmr1, silencing the expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (1). FMRP is an RNA binding protein that plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity and its loss results in debilitating behavioural symptoms (2). For instance, mutation in Fmr1 is the leading monogenic cause of both inherited cognitive impairment and autism (1). Many individuals with FXS exhibit hyperactivity and communication deficits (3). FXS has been extensively studied using the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model, which recapitulates behavioral features of FXS including hyperactivity and impaired vocal communication (4,5). Pilot studies in collaboration with Dr. Ray Turner have confirmed these two behavioral features in Fmr1 KO mice. Though researchers have explored potential therapeutic targets for FXS, no effective treatment is currently available (6). The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has historically been used as a non- pharmacological treatment for refractory epilepsy (7,8). Recently, the KD was shown to reduce behavioural symptoms of autism in the BTBR T+tf/j (BTBR) mouse model (9). Specifically, the KD improved the sociability of BTBR mice in the three-chamber test and enhanced BTBR social communication of a food preference (9). These findings suggest that the KD could serve as an effective treatment for the autism-like behaviours seen in FXS. The molecular mechanisms underlying KD effects on autism-like behaviors are not fully understood (10). However, a recent study found elevated levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, in hippocampal tissues of KD-fed rats, suggesting that the KD may exert its effects by modifying neurotransmitter levels (11). Defects in GABA signalling have been observed in both idiopathic autism and FXS, indicating that GABA signalling may play an important role in mediating the abnormal behaviours seen in both disorders (12). Here, I propose to examine whether the KD will alleviate behavioural symptoms of FXS in Fmr1 KO mice. I will also examine whether the KD increases brain GABA concentrations in Fmr1 KO mice to provide further evidence for or against the role of GABA in mediating behavioural effects of the KD. Methods: This study will use male Fmr1 KO mice (FVB/129S background) and wild-type FVB/129S control mice. When mice reach four weeks of age, cages will be randomly assigned to control standard diet (SD) or KD. Thus, there will be four experimental groups: WT_SD, WT_KD, KO_SD, and KO_KD. Treatment will last for ten days before behavioral testing and tissue harvest. Three cohorts of mice will be tested and a total of 12-15 mice per group will be used. 1) Ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) test for vocal communication Adult rodents produce USVs during social encounters (13). USVs serve as an indicator of social interest and motivation (13). Previous studies demonstrated that Fmr1 KO mice emit fewer USVs than wild-type controls (14), mirroring the communication deficits seen in FXS. To record USVs, an ultrasound microphone (Avisoft UltraSoundGate condenser CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) will be positioned 20 cm above a cage containing the test mouse. A sexually mature female mouse of the same strain will be introduced to the cage and USVs will be recorded for five minutes between 60 and 200 kHz using Avisoft-RECORDER software (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany). Recordings will be converted to sonographic ultrasound structures using Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction software, an open-access tool for MATLAB (15). The number, duration, frequency, and amplitude of calls will be quantified. 2) Open field test (OFT) for hyperactivity The OFT is used to measure general activity and exploratory drive in rodents (16). The test is also used to assess anxiety-related behaviours, because wild-type rodents show aversion to exposed fields and prefer to remain in peripheral areas (17). Previous studies demonstrated that Fmr1 KO mice show a hyperactive phenotype in the OFT compared to wild-type controls (18,19,20). To perform the OFT, mice will be individually placed in a novel square space of known dimensions, wherein escape is prevented by a surrounding wall. Mouse movement will be recorded on a camera for 30 minutes. The video will be tracked using Noldus EthoVision XT software (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands). Time spent in the center arena, distance travelled in the center arena, average velocity and total distance travelled will be quantified. 3) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for GABA concentrations We will examine whether the increase in brain GABA concentrations reported in KD-fed rats (11) can be replicated in Fmr1 KO mice. GABA concentrations in lysates from different brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum) will be quantified using a commercially available ELISA kit (GABA ELISA Kit, ImmuSmol, Pessac, France). Hypothesis: The ketogenic diet will alleviate behavioural symptoms of FXS in Fmr1 knockout (FVB/129S background) mice through an increase in GABA levels. Academic impact: There is currently no treatment for fragile X syndrome that effectively addresses the debilitating behavioural symptoms of the disorder (6). While efficacy of the KD in mitigating autism-like behavioural deficits has been demonstrated in the BTBR mouse model of autism (9), these findings must be validated in different animal models before translation of the KD into a clinical treatment can occur (10). This study will examine the effects of the KD on clinically relevant behaviours in a mouse model of FXS, a disorder that overlaps with idiopathic autism in both pathophysiology and clinical presentation (21). As such, this project has the potential to provide further validation for the KD as a treatment for autism-like behaviours. There is also a need for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the KD exerts its effects on behaviour (10). This study will shed light on the role of GABA in mediating behavioural effects of the KD, thus helping to elucidate KD mechanisms of action and opening doors to future targeted therapies for individuals with FXS and autism.","Fragile X syndrome is a brain disorder caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. Many people with fragile X are hyperactive and have problems with communication. Fragile X is often studied using mutant Fmr1 knockout mice, which are hyperactive and make fewer calls than normal mice. Unfortunately, there is still no cure for fragile X. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet that is used to treat epilepsy. In this project, I will test whether the ketogenic diet can fix some of the problematic behaviours associated with fragile X. First, I will feed the ketogenic diet to Fmr1 knockout mice. Next, I will run tests for hyperactivity and vocal communication to see if the ketogenic diet causes Fmr1 knockout mice to behave more like normal mice. I also want to understanding how the ketogenic diet changes brain chemistry. Recently, researchers found that rats fed the ketogenic diet had higher levels of GABA in their brains. GABA is a chemical that reduces the activity of neurons. Here, I will study whether the ketogenic diet increases GABA levels in the brains of Fmr1 knockout mice as it does in rats. A better understanding of whether and how the ketogenic diet affects behaviour will open the door to development of effective fragile X treatments.",,"Mice, Gaba, Autism, Behavioural",Fragile X Syndrome,n,GABA,Ketogenic Diet,Nutrition,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2018,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/could_the_ketogenic_diet_help_treat_fragile_x_syndrome,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/raven-yip-40955a129/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raven-Yip,,University of Calgary,Alberta Health Services,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Xingyu (Amy) Chen,,Jong Rho,De-Mystifying the Ketogenic Diet's Effects on the Brain,"Background: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). The condition affects nearly 140,000 Canadians and an estimated 50 million people globally. While most patients are responsive to one or more anti-seizure drugs, approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy do not respond to conventional pharmacologic interventions and instead suffer the burden of medically intractable epilepsy. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein diet that has been used as an efficacious treatment for those with medically intractable epilepsy for nearly a century. In general, nearly half of all patients treated with the KD show at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 10-15% of patients become seizure-free. The KD affects various metabolic pathways, and up-regulated ketogenesis (production of ketone bodies [KB] such as β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) is a hallmark of the diet. BHB is the primary KB that is elevated during treatment with the KD and exists in two enantiomeric forms: D-BHB and L-BHB. While the KD has been a reliable alternative to traditional anti- seizure drugs since the 1920’s, the relationship between circulating BHB and seizure suppression has proven inconsistent. Recent data, however, suggests a trending correlation between blood-plasma levels of D-BHB and seizure frequency in children (Buchhalter et al., 2017). Additionally, little is known about whether L-BHB in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is correlated with seizure frequency, or whether there are appreciable differences between the two stereoisomers in plasma and CSF. Furthermore, adherence to the KD can be a struggle for some patients as the restrictive nature of the diet can be unpalatable, resulting in patient non-compliance and diminished efficacy of the intervention. Exogenous ketone-ester (KE) supplementation is one potentially efficacious treatment alternative to the KD that may have the same anti-seizure benefits of a traditional KD, while ameliorating the unpalatability of the diet. Thus, the objective for this summer research project is to investigate whether ketone ester supplementation can mimic the elevations in BHB seen in KD treated rats, and furthermore, whether KEs affect plasma and CSF levels of D-BHB and L-BHB. The specific aim will be to determine whether treatment with exogenous ketone esters affects circulating levels of D-BHB and L-BHB in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Methods: Blood-plasma and CSF samples will be collected serially from anaesthetized Wistar rats. The samples will be analyzed for the presence of the D- and L- enantiomers of β-hydroxybutyric acid using the liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) method. To assess blood plasma and CSF concentrations of D-BHB and L-BHB, cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma will be sampled from male Wistar rats at 2 intervals: the first collection will occur at postnatal day 24 (P24), prior to beginning KE supplementation, and again after 10 days of KE administration. To sample CSF serially, rats will be anaesthetized with isoflurane and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. The head of the rat will be declined at a steep angle (~110°) to expose an area above the cisterna magna (collection site). The area will be shaved and cleaned with alternating alcohol and iodine solutions, and a 23G biopsy needle (Cook Medical, Ref# G00934) connected to a sterile collection syringe will be slowly inserted into the cisterna magna. 20 μL of CSF will be withdrawn and deposited into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and immediately placed on ice. Following CSF collection, 500 μL of whole blood will be collected from the saphenous vein and deposited into a blood-collection tube containing lithium- heparin, mixed by inverting 10x, and immediately placed on ice. After recovering the animal, the CSF and blood-plasma samples will be centrifuged, and the supernatant storage at -80°C. To administer ketone ester solutions, rats will be weighed, gently restrained, and KE (2.5g/kg/day) will be deposited into the animal’s stomach using an oral feeding needle (Kent Scientific, FNS- 10-6). KE will be administered daily for 10 days during which the animal’s will have ad libitum access to food (standard diet [SD]) and water. After 10 days of KE supplementation, CSF and blood plasma will be sampled again. To assay for the presence of D- BHB and L-BHB, samples of CSF and plasma will be transported to the Biochemical Genetics Laboratory at the Alberta Children’s Hospital and analyzed using the liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Hypothesis: Our central hypothesis is that exogenous ketone ester supplementation will elevate blood-plasma and CSF levels of D-BHB and L- BHB. As per our Specific Aim stated above, the blood-plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of D-BHB and L-BHB are expected to increase in response to treatment with exogenous ketone esters. This is based on studies highlighting the observed elevation of the racemate BHB (D- and L- enantiomers not distinguished) in response to KE supplementation in rats. Academic impact: Currently, there is no cure for epilepsy, and although there are effective pharmacologic interventions to manage the disorder in a small majority of patients, most bear negative side-effects. More insidious, however, are those patients who don’t respond to traditional pharmacologic treatment at all. For nearly a century, the KD has proven to be an efficacious treatment alternative to managing epilepsy, including medically intractable epilepsy. Though the exact mechanism through which the KD exerts its anti- seizure effects is likely pleiotropic in nature, there are trending relationships linking plasma and CSF BHB concentrations with seizure suppression. Furthermore, because there are two enantiomers of BHB (D and L), it is possible that the anti-seizure effects of the KD may be mediated by one or the other isomer which could yield even greater efficacy in managing epilepsy by avoiding administration of therapeutically inert substances. However, the diet is not a panacea for epilepsy, and bears its own negative side-effects for some patients such as unpalatability, nausea, and diarrhea increasing the likelihood of patient non-compliance and ineffective treatment. KE supplementation offers a promising compromise, and has already been shown to be an effective anti-convulsant treatment (D’Agostino et al., 2013; Ciarlone et al., 2016). The results of this research could contribute to the advancement of appropriate, inexpensive, and efficacious dietary therapies to manage epilepsy while avoiding some of the negative side-effects of a traditional KD.","The focus of the project is to investigate the potential of ketone ester (KE) supplementation as an alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet (KD). This project takes a basic science approach by using a mouse model to examine the role of a chemical known as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in seizure suppression. Although BHB is a primary chemical that is elevated in the KD, little is known about it. However, past studies have suggested that an increased level of BHB is associated with seizure suppression. Therefore, to assess the effect of the KE on levels of BHB, we will be measuring the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of mice given KE supplements. Based on previous studies, we anticipate that the blood-plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of BHB will increase. A better understanding of how KE supplementation alters the levels of BHB within the body could provide more insight into the role of BHB in seizure suppression. This insight could lead to the development of more effective dietary therapies without the side-effects and restrictive nature of the traditional KD.",,"BHB, Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF), Plasma, Blood, Seizure",Epilepsy,n,β-hydroxybutyrate,Ketone Ester Supplementation,Nutrition,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2018,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/de_mystifying_the_ketogenic_diet_s_effects_on_the_brain,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-chen-b4828b118/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xingyu-Chen-53,,,Alberta Health Services,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miriam Robak,,Phyllis Paterson,Is Poor Diet putting Stroke Recovery out of REACH?,"Background: Many individuals who suffer a stroke do not fully recover. For example, deficits in motor function commonly persist permanently and cause difficulty in walking or performing upper arm functions such as reaching for and grasping objects. This reduces the quality of life and ability to perform basic tasks of daily living. Rehabilitation therapies often ignore the potential benefit of also treating co-morbidity factors, which may be essential to support optimal recovery. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is an example of a co-morbidity factor that commonly arises in stroke patients, yet its prevention and treatment remain unresolved problems (1). The PEM that develops because of a stroke can affect 20–35% of patients in the first week (2,3) and 35–49% by admission to rehabilitation (4,5). PEM develops because of barriers to eating and nutritional support that are challenging to treat, including physical and mental disabilities (2,6). Swallowing difficulty is a particular risk factor (7). Other causes are decreased consciousness, depression, reduced mobility, and face or arm weakness (6,8). In Canada, only 60% of dietitians screen for PEM in stroke patients, and the majority rely on non-validated tools (9). This speaks to inadequate dietitian resources. Without a hospital-wide PEM screening program, dietitians will only see these patients if referred to them. The lack of attention to nutrition in stroke care may be because nutrition is viewed as a “supportive” treatment unlikely to yield direct and substantial effects on the brain and its inherent recovery mechanisms. Previous research from the Paterson lab challenges that idea (10,11). What are the effects of untreated PEM on stroke recovery? Cause and effect relationships have been difficult to establish in clinical studies, given study flaws and limited sample sizes, but correlations have been drawn between PEM and increased risk of morbidity and poorer functional outcome (2,8,12,13). To remove the unavoidable confounding influences inherent in clinical studies, the Paterson laboratory utilizes preclinical models of malnourished stroke patients. This approach allows testing of cause and effect relationships between nutritional care and post-stroke disability as well as the study of brain mechanisms by which nutrition modulates specific motor functions (e.g. walking, reaching). This can help explain poorer clinical stroke outcomes such as greater length of hospital stay and reduced scores for activities of daily living. Methods: Experimental Design: In order to mimic a malnourished stroke patient, the Paterson research laboratory has developed well-characterized preclinical (rat) models of photothrombotic stroke (14) accompanied by PEM (15). This allows one to examine the effects of PEM (compared to optimal nutritional status) on functional recovery after a stroke coupled with biochemical analysis of brain tissue. The experimental groups that have been generated include: Control (optimal diet)– sham, Control–stroke, PEM–sham and PEM –stroke (n=13-16/group). The infarct caused by the stroke occurs in the motor cortex region, which controls the rat’s forelimb. Functional recovery was assessed by reaching ability in the Montoya staircase and sensory-motor function in the adhesive removal test. All tissue samples have been collected. Methods: I will learn and apply selected techniques to evaluate mechanisms of recovery in brain tissue from this study: A. Laboratory analysis of brain injury, plasticity, and inflammation: I will work closely with Dr. Sally Caine, Research Associate, to measure the following endpoints: i) infarct size – measurement of infarct volume by histological assessment; ii) brain cortical plasticity and inflammation. e.g. synaptophysin, growth-associated protein-43, microtubule-associated protein-2, and glial (ED1, GFAP) immunolabelling (10,11). These methods are established in the lab; however, I will require training in cryostat sectioning, staining, identification of the infarct, and immunohistochemistry. B. Statistical analysis of these data: a) Analysis of variance tests and post-hoc testing – I will use the SPSS program to examine the effects of both the stroke and the nutritional intervention, and their interaction on the above endpoints. b) Regression analysis of the above biochemical data to the functional data acquired on reaching ability and sensory- motor function: I will use the SPSS program to determine the extent to which the biochemical mechanisms contribute to the functional outcomes. C. Preparation of data figures and tables: I will be responsible for generating figures and tables suitable for publication. This task will include becoming familiar with journal requirements for publication. D. Obtain practice in critiquing journal articles and presenting my research findings at weekly lab meetings. The Paterson lab takes an integrative, multi-system approach to stroke recovery. In addition to brain plasticity, tissue samples from this study have been collected to investigate stroke-induced skeletal muscle changes in the stroke- affected versus non-affected limbs. My exposure to these experiments at weekly lab meetings will provide me with a broad understanding of the extent to which nutrition influences post-stroke recovery through multiple body systems and mechanisms. Hypothesis: Optimal nutritional status will enhance recovery of motor function after cortical stroke by yielding direct effects on multiple organ systems that include the brain mechanisms of neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation. Academic impact: Protein-energy malnutrition remains a problem for many stroke patients. A major contributing reason may be because the implications for patient disability are not fully appreciated. I will assist in taking the first step to determine whether proactive prevention of post-stroke PEM is essential for optimal recovery, and if so, to elucidate key contributing mechanisms. I will thus help to publish the findings of the first preclinical study to address this question as it pertains to cortical stroke and motor function. For maximum impact in the stroke care field, the goal is to submit this manuscript to a journal that is focused on stroke research (e.g. Stroke or Translational Stroke Research). A conference where clinical and preclinical researchers meet to enhance translation will also be targeted, and thus research findings will be presented at the 11th World Stroke Congress in Montreal on Oct 17-20, 2018. I will also have the opportunity to present posters at the University of Saskatchewan fall 2018 Neuroscience Research Day and the spring 2019 Life and Health Sciences Research Expo.","A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Many stroke survivors have permanent problems with walking or upper arm function due to inadequate treatment. I am studying how optimal nutrition can be used to assist with recovery of the brain after a stroke. This is important because multiple challenges caused by the stroke (e.g. difficulty in swallowing and feeding oneself, depression, or mobility problems), cause patients to develop malnutrition. By 1 week after stroke, 20–35% of patients are affected, and this rises to ~35–49% during the rehabilitation period. We use surgery to cause a stroke in rats in a part of the brain that controls normal reaching and grasping. Animals are fed varying diets after the stroke. This includes diets deficient in protein and energy as compared to nutritionally adequate diets. The ability of the rat to reach for and handle objects skillfully is measured with a behavioral test. Brain damage is measured by the volume of the damaged region. We also do lab testing on brain samples to tell us how these nutritional conditions and treatments affect recovery. Our long-term goal is to develop new approaches to nutritional care of patients after stroke that can work alongside physical rehabilitation to improve recovery.",,"PEM, Recovery, Motor, Mechanisms, Nutritional",Stroke,n,Motor Recovery,Diet,"Nutrition, Rehabilitation",Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Saskatchewan,2018,8000,8000,,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/is_poor_diet_putting_stroke_recovery_out_of_reach,,1,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriam-robak-267132b8,,,,"The Alex Community Health Centre, St. Elizabeth Healthcare",,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mason Schindle,,Vivian Mushahwar,Walking with a zap after a Spinal Cord Injury,"Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological trauma that commonly results in paralysis and secondary complications that include spasticity, bladder dysfunction, respiratory complications, and muscular atrophy (Bamford et al, 2017). Overall, as many as 500,000 individuals suffer a SCI worldwide each year, presenting a plethora of complications to the quality of life of those affected and placing a substantial financial burden on health care systems (World Health Organization, 2013). To date, there is no cure for spinal cord injury due to the fact that the neural tissue in the spinal cord has limited ability to regenerate and re-form connections. Although pharmacological intervention with the goal of promoting natural regeneration is widespread in SCI research, several forms of electrical stimulation — an alternative treatment option — have demonstrated efficacy in promoting endogenous neuroregeneration and reorganization following central nervous system damage (Palm et al, 2014). In particular, one novel, yet more invasive form of electrical stimulation known as intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) has not only demonstrated the ability to facilitate functional movements (i.e. standing, stepping, walking) in animals with SCI, but also in ameliorating secondary complications such as bladder dysfunction (Bamford et al, 2011). ISMS involves the application of low levels of electrical current through microwires that have been implanted into the spinal cord (below the level of lesion) to generate functional movements in a fatigue-resistant manner. Although ISMS has been around for several decades, it has only recently been explored over the past decade as a tool for the restoration of movement in individuals with SCI (Bamford et al, 2011). As a result, there is a significant gap in research in regards to the potentially neuroregenerative effects of routine ISMS within the spinal cord following injury. In effect, this study aims to assess the presence and extent of functionally adaptive neural reorganization within the spinal cord as a result of routine intraspinal microstimulation. Overall, this study will assess these changes in rats with complete spinal cord injuries through utilization of functional measures of muscle force, as well as through analysis of protein markers that are capable of highlighting synaptic and axonal sprouting/reorganization. Methods: Fourteen rats will be subjected to a complete spinal cord transection at the eighth thoracic vertebra (T8). Following a two week recovery period, a laminectomy will be performed on all of the rats to expose spinal cord segments T13 and L1. Microwire arrays will then be implanted into the appropriate sectors of the ventral grey-matter on both sides of the spinal cord such that stimulation of these microwires activates the flexor and extensor muscles in the legs necessary to produce a walking cycle. However, only seven of the rats will function as the ISMS experimental group while the other seven function as the sham control, receiving no spinal stimulation. Following a one week recovery period, the stimulation protocol for the experimental group will commence. During the recovery periods it is possible that the rats may develop pressure ulcers. As a result, over-night postoperative care measures will likely need to be taken to palpate the limbs of the rats periodically to avoid this. The stimulation protocol will involve 4 consecutive hours of interleaved stimulation every day for 30 days to produce the functional limb kinematics necessary to evoke a walking pattern. Thereafter, the data acquisition stage will commence. A functional measure of hindlimb muscle force will be obtained from both the experimental and sham subjects. Thereafter, protein markers that are capable of highlighting axonal and synaptic sprouting/reorganization (i.e. Growth Associated Protein 43 and Synaptophysin) will be utilized in the experimental and sham groups to cross- examine the extent of neuroregeneration through immunohistochemistry. Differences between the experimental and sham subjects hindlimb muscle force and neuroplastic protein expression will be analyzed to test the utility of intraspinal microstimulation in promoting endogenous neuroregeneration within the spinal cord following injury. Hypothesis: Spinal cord injured rats that are subjected to a routine intraspinal microstimulation protocol to walk may showcase functionally adaptive neural reorganization within the spinal cord. These neural changes will be examined through both a functional measure of hindlimb muscle force, as well as through analysis of protein expression associated with synaptic and axonal sprouting. Academic impact: The technology behind intraspinal microstimulation holds great potential. ISMS is capable of producing natural-looking, weight-bearing, and fatigue-resistant functional movements (i.e. standing, stepping, walking) in animal models of spinal cord injury (Holinski et al, 2016). Additionally, electrical stimulation has demonstrated utility in ameliorating secondary complications associated with SCI such as pain and spasticity (Tator et al, 2012). In this study, the neuroregenerative features of intraspinal microstimulation in a rat model of complete spinal cord injury will be systematically investigated. This will be the first study of its kind and may contribute to the above list of benefits by showcasing that ISMS also has neuroregenerative properties. The findings from this study will be captivating to other neuroscientists in this field as this neuroregenerative investigation is necessary to further fuel the transition of ISMS from the lab bench to clinical application in the near future, providing immediate benefits for those with SCI. Additionally, it will be fascinating to see how the neuroregenerative effects of ISMS stack up to current pharmacological intervention. The results from this study may provide further support for the transition away from pharmaceutical treatment towards the interlacement of artificial stimulation. It should be noted that several other forms of electrical stimulation (i.e. epidural electrical stimulation) have demonstrated efficacy in promoting endogenous neuroregeneration within the human nervous system (Ahuja et al, 2016). However, due to the more direct nature of intraspinal microstimulation, the neuroregenerative effects of ISMS may be even more impressive than what has been showcased in the literature surrounding less direct modalities. This is due to the fact that by activating the neural networks in a more natural order, ISMS may be able to facilitate focal plasticity that is functionally relevant. This is an important question that needs answering. The findings from this research study will also be captivating to other neuroscientists in the field of SCI research due to the implications for ISMS application in incomplete spinal cord injury. Granted this research study is capable of illustrating that ISMS produces impactful neuroregeneration in a model of complete SCI, there may be even greater neuroregenerative capacity in those with incomplete spinal cord injury. This is due to the fact that in incomplete spinal cord injury, there are spared resident neural networks still active and able to cultivate new connections. In effect, I believe this study will catalyze further investigation into the value of ISMS in incomplete spinal cord injury as well.","Spinal cord injury occurs as a result of damage to the spinal cord, often resulting in paralysis. Unfortunately, as many as 500,000 individuals suffer a spinal cord injury each year, and there is no cure because the tissue within the spinal cord is unable to regenerate and re-form its previous connections. Using rats as a model of humans, this project first aims to use a procedure called ‘intraspinal microstimulation’ (ISMS) to restore the rats ability to stand and walk. Intraspinal microstimulation works by inserting very small wires into the spinal cord, and running low levels of electricity through them. By stimulating the “control centre” for standing and walking in the spinal cord with the correct pattern, the rats leg muscles are activated such that they can stand and walk again. Overall, the goal of this project is to look at whether the tissue within the spinal cord is now able to heal itself, and if so, to what extent due to the spinal stimulation. Depending on the outcome of research encompassing intraspinal microstimulation and spinal cord injury, including this study, intraspinal microstimulation technology may be able to transfer to a clinical setting in the next decade to mitigate spinal cord injury in humans, allowing them to walk again.",,"Spinal, isms, Stimulation, Injury, Functional",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Neuroplaticity,Intraspinal Microstimulation,"Mobility, Treatment",Animal,Basic,"Tech, Mind and Body",University of Alberta,2018,"8,000.00","2,000.00",,,,,,,"2,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/walking_with_a_zap_after_a_spinal_cord_injury,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/masonschindle/,,,University of Alberta,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dhyey Bhatt,,Cam Teskey,"Keto Diet: protein, fat and oxygen?","Background: Seizures cause many diverse and severe deficits in the post-ictal period that resemble impairments seen due to hypoxic events. A period of severe hypoxia following the termination of a seizure is responsible for behavioural and cognitive impairments observed acutely following seizures and may be responsible for long-term deficits as well. This hypoxic period is caused by vasoconstriction that leads to hypoperfusion. Over repeated occurrences this phenomenon may lead to inflammation, glial activation, and neuronal loss, all of which may contribute to the chronic cognitive and behavioural deficits observed in people with seizure disorders. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme plays a major role in the constriction of vascular smooth muscle because blocking or knocking down COX-2 activity, both the post-ictal hypoxic state and associated behavioural deficits can be prevented. This enzyme has also thought to be a major contributor to the production of many inflammatory prostanoids, which are contributors to neurological damage associated with seizure- induced neuroinflammation. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet known as the ketogenic diet (KD) has been recently demonstrated as a potential treatment for various neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease. The diet results in a shift of the primary energy source that is utilized by the brain from carbohydrates to ketones. This shift and the alteration of nutrients available can modify the biological activity of different enzymes and proteins. Specifically, the ketogenic diet has been shown to down regulate cyclooxygenase enzymes and may be beneficial in the treatment of pharmaco-resistant seizures. By decreasing the inflammatory and vasoconstrictive responses following a seizure, the magnitude of hypoxia and inflammatory related damage would be dampened, leading to better behavioural and cognitive outcomes. Translationally, the ketogenic diet provides an alternative to pharmaceutical therapies that are ineffective for some individuals and offers a viable treatment option if effective. This diet will be used in conjunction with an electrical kindling model of evoked focal seizures that reliably produces hypoxic events after a seizure which are markedly similar in magnitude and duration to a spontaneous seizure. Methods: In this study, rats will be randomly assigned to either a KD or regular diet condition with approximately 15 rats in each group. An oxygen- sensing probe (optrode) and bipolar electrode will be implanted into CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus and CA3 of the ventral hippocampus respectively. The optrode continuously records the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 in mmHg) in awake, freely-moving rats before, during, and after brief electrographic and behavioural seizures. Rats in the KD condition will be switched to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet 14 days prior to initiation of electrical kindling to ensure rats are in ketosis before the initiation of seizure induction. Blood ketone levels will be continuously monitored using saphenous leg bleeds. Electric kindling will be elicited through the application of brief stimulation (1 s train of 1 ms pulses at 60 Hz) through the chronically implanted bipolar electrode. Using a kindling protocol, suprathreshold electrical stimulation of the hippocampus will be used to induce reliable behavioral seizures. Tissue oxygen saturation will be monitored for at least 60 minutes following seizure termination or until they return to baseline oxygen levels. Availability of COX-2 approximately 70 minutes following the final seizure will be measured through mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus using quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). Hippocampal levels of neuroinflammatory markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglial activation markers such as ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 will also be measured to observe direct physiological effects of the KD on the post- seizure response. Hypothesis: Given the ketogenic diet’s proven ability to reduce levels of COX-2 (an important enzyme involved in the synthesis of compounds that act at smooth muscle sites promoting vasoconstriction) it can be hypothesized that following seizure termination rats within the KD group will demonstrate oxygen levels within the normoxic range in the hippocampus over the post-ictal period. These animals, in comparison to their controls which fall below the severe hypoxic threshold, should inevitably result in fewer behavioural and cognitive deficits. Results from qPCR should indicate lower levels of COX-2, inflammatory, and microglial activation markers in the hippocampus after seizures given that the KD is effective in providing physiological benefit. Academic impact: The post-ictal hypoxia model of seizures utilized in this study provides a quantifiable therapeutic target by which the benefits of using a therapy such as the ketogenic diet can be measured. The utility and potential of the ketogenic diet has been increasingly studied recently, however there are gaps in literature in regards to its potential in reducing the severity of hypoxia experienced during the post-ictal period. This knowledge would not only provide evidence for potential therapeutic purposes of the ketogenic diet, but also a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the diet and post-ictal hypoxia. Understanding these concepts would serve to provide a stronger, more comprehensive foundation for future research in these fields.","Research has shown that for approximately one hour after a seizure, there is limited oxygen supply in the part of the brain that was affected. This lack of oxygen is thought to be the cause of many of the negative behavioral and cognitive symptoms that arise after a seizure. The mechanism behind this oxygen deficit is thought to be mediated by an enzyme known as COX-2, which is involved the constriction of blood vessels. In this study, the potential of a high-fat, low- carbohydrate diet known as the ketogenic diet, on reducing the oxygen deficit caused by seizures is being observed. Why this diet? Although current popular practice of the ketogenic diet is used for reasons such as weight loss, it has shown to be able to reduce levels of the enzyme COX-2 which may be a major contributor to the oxygen deficiency that is observed after a seizure. Using rats fitted with oxygen sensors in their brains, the effect that the diet has on oxygen levels after a seizure as well as other markers for brain damage can be studied. If the diet is shown to be effective, it creates a promising foundation for a possible ketogenic diet therapy for seizures in the near future.",,"Diet, Seizure, Ketogenic, Behavioural, Hippocampus",Epilepsy,n,Oxygen,Ketogenic Diet,Nutrition,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Mind and Body,University of Calgary,2019,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/keto_diet_protein_fat_and_oxygen,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=QiLrvmAAAAAJ&hl=en,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhyeybhatt/,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Dhyey-Bhatt-2161324324,https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/ ,University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Julie Joyce,,Chantel Debert,How does Mindfulness Promote Mental Health Resilience in Adolescents?,"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health and socioeconomic problem. An estimated sixty-nine million individuals worldwide sustain a TBI each year making TBI among the most commonly occurring injuries [1]. Most of the injured survive with significant disabilities [2-3]. While progress is being made for treatment in the early stages post-TBI, the most significant gains to returning to daily activities follow rehabilitation. Without sufficient tools to detect TBI-induced impairments, clinicians struggle to focus their rehabilitation interventions to address specific patient needs. Current assessment techniques of TBI-induced impairment are primarily clinical in nature. New technological advances which aim to improve detection and quantification of deficits are emerging in the field of TBI rehabilitation. While promising, these technologies have yet to be evaluated extensively in patients across age groups and classes of TBI severity, a crucial step before they will be integrated into clinical practice. The most common debilitating symptoms that occur following a TBI are caused by dysfunction of the vestibular and oculomotor systems [4-8]. These symptoms can manifest as dizziness, vertigo, fogginess, motion sensitivity, gait imbalance, gaze instability, and blurred vision [9]. Lack of a ‘gold standard’ method of assessment often means deficits go unnoticed by clinicians. This study brings together international experts in TBI rehabilitation to evaluate the use of technology in the assessment and rehabilitation of vestibulo-ocular impairments in individuals with TBI. Recently, vestibulo-ocular dysfunction has been identified as significant risk factor for post- concussion syndrome in pediatric patients [9], emphasizing the need to improve detection in order to develop targeted rehabilitation. This important research study aims to gain a better understanding of visual and vestibular dysfunction across the entire TBI severity spectrum (mild to severe) and at various time points throughout the lifespan. Secondly, it aims to compare assessments of vestibulo-ocular dysfunction using new technological tools to current clinical assessments to improve detection and quantification of these deficits. My contribution to the study aims to elucidate the efficacy of clinical versus technological vestibulo-ocular assessments in pediatric and adult patients who have sustained a moderate/severe TBI. Pilot work in individuals with and without TBI and the preliminary data we have collected so far for this study shows that these approaches could be powerful and effective interventions for this population [10,11]. There is an urgent need to translate these new developments into clinical rehabilitation. Methods: Study overview: SiMPly rehab is a transnational study with research centres in Paris, Tel-Aviv, Montreal, and Calgary. We will be conducting a case series, feasibility and validation study that will encompass an evaluation of current and experimental vestibular-ocular assessment techniques. Participants: 14 pediatric patients who have suffered a moderate- severe TBI will be recruited from rehabilitation centres in the Paris region. Inclusion criteria includes individuals 6-17 years of age that have suffered a moderate-severe TBI and have been cleared by a rehabilitation specialist to participate in research. Initial screening: A thorough neurological exam identify other clinical findings and coexistent diagnoses will occur for all participants. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), and the Child Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (Child SCAT-5) questionnaires will be administered. Clinical assessments: We will use the procedures described in the Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS) for Concussion module to assess ocular impairment. We will be conducting the Head Thrust Test which has been used to identify individuals with peripheral vestibular hypofunction. Balance tests will include the Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, the Functional Gait Assessment, the Balance Error Scoring System, and the Walk While Talk Test. Technological assessments: Otometrics eye-tracking goggles will be used to assess visual performance. These glasses enable participants to explore their visual environment while a camera tracks their pupils. Computerized Dynamic Visual Acuity will be measured using a NeuroCom InVision System. The Head Impulse Test, which uses accelerometers and cameras, combined with rapid computerized pupil tracking software to examine the vestibulo-ocular reflex, will also be conducted. The iPad-based Standing Balance Test will be used to quantify balance impairments. All questionnaires, clinical, and technological exams will be conducted at baseline and at an 8-week follow-up. Statistical analyses: The data collected in France will be compared to data that I have collected throughout the previous nine months working with adult moderate/severe TBI patients. A Cohen’s kappa analysis will be run to determine if there is agreement between clinical and technological assessments on whether were normal or abnormal. Paired t-tests and descriptive statistics will be used to examine functional change between the baseline and 8-week follow-up appointments in adult and pediatric patients. Inter-site communication: Bi-weekly videoconference meetings will be held between the study sites in Calgary and Paris accompanied by monthly videoconference meetings with all sites. Weekly email correspondence will occur between sites to address logistics and any issues that arise. Hypothesis: Hypothesis I: The use of technology-based visual and vestibular assessments in addition to current clinical evaluation of TBI patients will improve clinicians’ abilities to detect TBI-induced vestibular and visual deficits and will allow clinicians to develop personalized rehabilitation protocols. Aim I: There will be a 50% greater detection rate of vision and vestibular deficits in patients with moderate to severe TBI with technology-based visual and vestibular tools compared to clinical assessment alone. Hypothesis II: Untreated visual and vestibular impairments will not recover spontaneously in adult or pediatric patients. We expect to see greater symptom improvement in pediatric versus adult patients due to the highly plastic nature of young brains. Aim II: Improve characterization of visual and vestibular impairment and functional recovery in both pediatric and adult patients. Academic impact: To date, there are no clinical assessment tools that accurately assess vestibular and ocular deficits in moderate to severe TBI. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the utility of more advanced technology in the assessment of these deficits following TBI. A gap in the literature exists in how we choose to measure early post-traumatic alterations in vision, vestibular function and visual perception, as well as in our understanding of the complex interaction between these systems. This study aims to explore more accurate diagnostic methods to diagnose visual and vestibular dysfunction following moderate to severe TBI. Another question that will be addressed is whether functional recovery occurs spontaneously in adult and/or pediatric patients with vestibular- ocular impairment secondary to moderate/severe TBI. Previous research in adults who suffer from mild TBI has shown that persistent vestibular-ocular symptoms are quite common. We have yet to uncover to what extent these symptoms persist in the absence of targeted rehabilitation interventions. There is very limited literature on visual and vestibular symptom recovery in moderate/severe TBI adult or pediatric patients. As vestibulo-ocular dysfunction has been shown to be a significant predictor of post-concussion syndrome in children, the negative implications of leaving these symptoms untreated are an important consideration. The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of technological tools to use in the assessment of oculomotor, vestibular and visual perception deficits after TBI, as well as to evaluate to what extent these symptoms resolve or fail to resolve in the absence of targeted rehabilitation approaches. We contend that technological assessment of the vestibular and visual systems could conceivably occur in moderate to severe TBI, in multiple practice settings, and improve detection of these deficits.","The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020 traumatic brain injuries (TBI) will be the most common cause of death and persistent injuries worldwide [12]. Dizziness, difficulty with balance (also called vestibular deficits) and vision problems are common symptoms that will occur following TBI. Many people can recover in the initial weeks following injury, but in some cases symptoms will persist and cause significant impairments in the ability of the patients to live independently or return to work and leisure activities. There is limited research evaluating the effectiveness of using technology to diagnose vision and dizziness problems after TBI. Thus, the aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate diagnostic tools that use new cutting-edge technology for individuals with vision and vestibular deficits that persist following moderate to severe TBI. 2) Gain a better understanding of whether these symptoms persist in children and adults who have not been given specialized rehabilitation exercises. This study will include 14 children who have experienced a moderate to severe TBI. We will use the best available technology to evaluate their vision, dizziness, and balance. We will compare the results of the technological tests with typical clinical tests currently used by doctors and physiotherapists. It is expected that this study will inform clinical practice and future research leading to a more effective treatment program for TBI that includes multiple components. Ultimately, this program will lead to better health care delivery and decreased public health burden from TBI.",,"TBI, Vestibular, Ocular, Rehabilitation, Pediatric","""Concussion, TBI""",y,Neuroplasticity,Exercise,"Pediatric, Treatment",Human,"Basic, Translational","Mind and Body, Tech",University of Calgary,2019,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/the_eyes_are_a_window_to_the_brain,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie-Joyce,,Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jade Stein,,Daniel Kopala-Sibley,,"Background: Mindfulness is intentional awareness of the present moment, including thoughts and sensations, without judgment or interference. The ability to harbor mindfulness in everyday life, known as dispositional mindfulness, increases with mindfulness meditation and is otherwise relatively stable over time (1, 2). Elevated dispositional mindfulness is associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms (3) and with better executive functioning (4) in adolescents. With approximately 20-25% of the population having experienced an anxiety or mood disorder, and roughly 60% of these cases first emerging during adolescence (5), mindfulness- based therapies have gained popularity in the last two decades to combat these debilitating mental illnesses. Little is known, however, about the neural underpinnings of dispositional mindfulness, cognitive functioning, and psychological well-being, especially in youth. Yet, mindfulness practices have been implemented in some schools without knowledge of their effects on the developing adolescent brain and psychopathology. The objective of my research is to examine the neural correlates of dispositional mindfulness in a sample of adolescents during a working memory functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) task and investigate their associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. Adolescence is marked by the neural maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC orchestrates decision making, inhibition, and orientating attention. With substantial physiological and social changes occurring in adolescence, the PFC is vulnerable to abnormal development (6). Dispositional mindfulness, however, may confer resiliency against anxiety and depression. This relationship may be partially mediated by the role of the PFC in mindfulness, as healthy development of the PFC to regulate emotions via cognitive control has been implicated as one resiliency factor against developing a psychiatric disorder in adolescence (7). Indeed, individuals with anxiety perform poorly on working memory tasks (8), which recruit the dorsolateral (dl) PFC and ventrolateral (vl) PFC. Working memory involves the manipulation and maintenance of information in the mind during cognitive tasks while inhibiting conflicting stimuli. With regard to mindfulness, working memory may play a role in goal-orientated nonjudgemental awareness and inhibition of habitual responding. Interestingly, expert meditators exhibit lower levels of dlPFC and vlPFC activation during meditation practice (10) and during executive functioning tasks (11). Furthermore, higher levels of dispositional mindfulness are associated with better working memory task performance (12). Thus, elevated dispositional mindfulness may infer less cognitive effort. Examining PFC functioning during an fMRI working memory task may therefore identify the underlying neural correlates of cognitive control and psychological well-being in adolescents with high dispositional mindfulness. Methods: Participants: We have recruited 55 participants in five months and have acquired data from 37 of these participants. Total recruitment will be 100 healthy adolescents aged 12-17 with a parental history of anxiety or depression. This is therefore a sample of youth at high risk for anxiety and depression. This sample will be 50% female. Materials & Methods: Dispositional mindfulness will be assessed via the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM). This measure shows good internal consistency and convergent validity with lower levels of thought suppression and psychological inflexibility (13). Adolescent and parent reports on the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCAD) (14) will be averaged to assess anxiety and depression symptoms in youth. Adolescent participants are also asked to provide information related to mindfulness experience (e.g., school-based, personal practice, or yoga) and duration, and are asked to complete the Big Five Inventory (BFI) of personality traits, which assesses neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality), a possible confounding variable in this study. Working memory will be assessed during fMRI scans via the well-validated and widely-used N-back task (15). In this task, the participant is presented with a series of stimuli (e.g., faces, shapes), and is asked to decide whether the current stimulus matches a stimulus from N steps earlier (e.g., two steps earlier), thus evoking both maintenance and manipulation of stimuli in the brain. N will be manipulated to increase working memory demand using a 0-back versus 2-back cognitive load. The N-back task reliably elicits activation in the dlPFC and vlPFC in adolescents (16). Afterward, participants will be asked to answer a likert scale question about their ability to stay on task during the exercise. Participants will also complete a List Sorting working memory task from NIH cognitive toolbox battery outside of the scanner. Analyses: I will correlate dispositional mindfulness scores obtained from the CAMM with anxiety and depression symptoms and working memory performance, assessed via accuracy on the 2-back task and the Reverse Digit Span task. I will also contrast the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in prefrontal regions during 0-back versus 2-back cognitive loads via a dlPFC and vlPFC region of interest (ROI) analysis using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM-12). These values will be correlated with dispositional mindfulness and anxiety and depression symptoms. Differences in neuroticism, mindfulness training experience, mind wandering, age, sex, and gender identity will be controlled for in these analyses. Hypothesis: Aim 1: Determine the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and anxiety and depression in a sample of at-risk adolescents. Based on previous findings, I hypothesize that elevated dispositional mindfulness will be associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Aim 2: I aim to investigate the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and working memory. I hypothesize that high levels of dispositional mindfulness will be associated with better performance on the N-back and List Sorting working memory tasks. Aim 3: I will examine the neural underpinnings of dispositional mindfulness as assessed via a working memory memory task in a sample of adolescents at high familial risk of developing anxiety or depression. I hypothesize that higher levels of dispositional mindfulness will be associated with lower dlPFC and vlPFC BOLD activation during a fMRI N- back task relative to those lower in dispositional mindfulness in a more versus less demanding cognitive load (i.e., 2-back versus 0-back). I further hypothesize that lower activation in these regions will in turn correlate with lower anxiety and depression symptoms. Academic impact: Mindfulness in adolescence is an understudied topic, yet mindfulness meditation and strategies are beginning to gain popularity in schools and in youth organizations. Thus, these programs are being implemented without knowledge of the underlying neurological effect that they have on the adolescent brain in regard to the risk for or resiliency against anxiety and depression. Hence, research in this area is required. Additionally, the introduction of mindfulness strategies during adolescence serves as a prime opportunity to assess the presence of dispositional mindfulness as adolescents are socially, physically, and cognitively maturing. As psychiatric conditions often emerge at this age, dispositional mindfulness may protect against neuroplastic insults from psychological and physical distress, or from familial risk. Determining how this effect may occur is therefore imperative for future psychopathological research. The current study will provide evidence that elevated dispositional mindfulness may confer resilience to depression and anxiety in adolescents. Results will also inform our understanding of the neural bases of mindfulness, and how it relates to working memory at a time when this process is cognitively developing. There is limited research in the field regarding working memory and dispositional mindfulness. This will serve as the first study to use fMRI to analyze this relationship, to my knowledge. Thus, results may further our understanding of the relationship between dispositional mindfulness, cognitive function, and depression and anxiety in adolescents. It may also stimulate further investigation of the directionality of these relationships in future longitudinal research. Indeed, this research is a part of a broader longitudinal study to assess risk and resiliency factors for the development of diagnosable anxiety and depressive episodes in adolescence. Thus, future research may assess how dispositional mindfulness confers resilience against the longitudinal development of depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnoses as the PFC matures.","What makes one person resilent to developing anxiety or depression and another person vulnerable?

Daphne Kaketsis,,Ephrem Zewdie,Controlling a SMART home with your smart brain,"Background: Few circumstances are more tragic than an intellectually capable child being trapped in a body that does not work. Cerebral palsy (CP) causes most lifelong disability, affecting >30000 Canadian children and over 17 million people worldwide. There are estimated to be hundreds of Canadian children with severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy or other neurological conditions who are cognitively normal but physically locked-in. Brain computer interfaces (BCI) incorporated to control SMART home technology could change the very nature of such a challenging life. BCI can read information from the human cortex such as changes that occur in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during specific thoughts. Smart computer algorithms then learn to recognize the meaning within each signal and can then translate this to control effector devices. SMART home technologies such as opening a door or turning on lights are one example but have not been explored as a BCI application in children. BCI are rapidly advancing toward user-friendly systems that could be more easily used by families in the community, facilitating such real-life applications. However, a major gap exists between such innovations and the families of affected children and the clinicians who care for them. Rapidly narrowing this gap are emerging, simpler, inexpensive technologies that could move BCI from advanced labs into the hands of families for home use. Realizing this potential requires new initiatives to generate child-friendly programs to test acquired BCI skills in controlling effector devices. We have recently demonstrated that school-age children, both typically developing and those with cerebral palsy, can quickly learn to control simple EEG-based BCI systems. We now aim to apply such progress toward SMART home systems in the hopes they could realize new levels of independence. Methods: This is a prospective, interventional pilot study. Participants will be children with severe neurological disability and preserved cognition and their families. This population in Calgary has already been identified through relevant clinician specialists at the Alberta Children’s Hospital and the ACH BCI Program. Inclusion criteria include (1) severe quadriplegia with minimal or no functional hand use (GMFCS level 5, MACS level 5), (2) estimated developmental cognitive capacity of 6 years (grade 1) or older, (3) near normal extraocular movements, hearing, and afferent visual function, and (4) informed consent/assent. By the time of this study, 10-12 families will be participating in the BCI Training Program, attending the recently established ACH BCI Laboratory on a weekly basis during which the following training will be advanced. We will employ an advanced EEG-based BCI system (g.tec, Graz, Austria). Enriched EEG data combined with more sophisticated computer analysis and algorithms allows execution of advanced BCI paradigms. Specifically, this study will use a well-established P300 technique where a participant’s attention to specific areas on a screen is combined with intermittent flashing lights on screen targets to generate a unique EEG potential that is then detected to achieve target selection. This selection will then be used to control effector devices using SMART home technology. This project will involve the design and testing of the interface between existing SMART home technology and BCI systems. Options for different levels of effector device control will be explored choosing suitable tasks based on developmental level and patient/parent preference. Using SMART home technology allows the experience in the lab to be directly translated to real world applications to give patients more independence and a better quality of life. The primary outcome will be the subjective ratings of success as reported by the participant and their parent. This will be measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) where participants set their own goals and then rank their performance and satisfaction (10 points scale) at set follow-ups (weekly). Secondary outcomes include performance success on instructed tasks (Cohen’s Kappa), a tolerability measure, and family narratives. As a personalized pilot study of individual patients and families, analysis will be primarily descriptive. Hypothesis: Our overall aim is to create a BCI integrated SMART home system for severely disabled children. In order to achieve this, we first need to develop a child-friendly interface between the two systems to engage children and families. The primary aim of this specific project is to construct, test, and translate a BCI integrated SMART home system for children with severe neuromotor impairment. Our research question is to determine if commercially available SMART home technology can be integrated with user-friendly BCI systems to allow severely disabled children to conduct daily activities independently. We hypothesize that most children with severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy can achieve an assisted level of action completion that results in subjective personal enjoyment and satisfaction. Academic impact: This work will eventually enhance function and independence in severely disabled children. We are uniquely positioned to lead the emerging field of BCI applications in stroke and cerebral palsy. For the first time, there is real hope of restoring meaningful function to children with severe disability and reducing the lifelong burden it places on their quality of life, family, and future potential.","This project will directly advance our efforts to build a child-centered BCI program for severely disabled young people and offer a direct connection to real life applications. Our recent experience highlights the potential for this project. In the last year, with a commercially available inexpensive BCI we purchased online for $300, we have helped 4 intelligent but completely physically disabled young people do things they never thought they would. This included an 8 year old boy driving a remote control car and a 9 year old boy playing a videogame for the first time in their lives. These skills that have been acquired through gaming experiences will now be translated to real life applications, in this case SMART home technology. The pure joy expressed by the children and their parents while doing these tasks was immeasurable and is the primary motivator to advance this work.",,"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), Children, Smart, Control, EEG","""Cerebral Palsy, Qualdriplegia""",n,Neuroplasticity,Brain Computer Interface,"Functional Independence, Pediatric",Human,Basic,Tech,University of Calgary,2019,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/controlling_a_smart_home_with_your_smart_brain,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daphne-kaketsis-m-sc-e-i-t-91b961135/,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Daphne-A-Kaketsis-2198525269,,,ENA2 Innovative Consulting Inc,,,dkaketsis@ena2.com,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicole Grant,,Jodie Gawryluk,Walk a Mile to Re-myel-inate in Multiple Sclerosis,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease characterized by widespread lesions and plaques in the central nervous system and changes in sensory, motor, and cognitive function (Henry, Tourbah, Chaunu, Backchine, & Montreuil, 2017). MS is frequently accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment (Henry, Tourbah, Chaunu, Backchine, & Montreuil, 2017). Several complex pathological processes are thought to contribute to the formation of MS lesions, including inflammation, demyelination, astrogliosis, oligodendrocyte injury, neurodegeneration, and axonal loss (Popescu et al., 2013). Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, most individuals with MS are diagnosed in young adulthood (ages 15-40) and rely on pharmaceuticals for long-term medical management with varying side effects, as there is no cure for MS. Globally, Canada has the highest prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in the world, with approximately 100 000 Canadians diagnosed (Stats Canada, 2017). This makes the study and development of accessible and low- cost treatments for MS in Canada crucial. As an alternative treatment to medical management, physical activity holds promise for individuals with MS. Recent research has shown that after exercising, individuals with MS experience positive effects on symptom management such as fewer depressive symptoms, less fatigue, and fewer cognitive concerns (Briken et al., 2014; Motl, & Sandroff, 2015). These findings are supported by previous research that has shown the positive effects of exercise on cognitive functioning in aging populations (e.g., Bherer, Erickson, & Liu-Ambrose, 2013) and the management of other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease (Svensson, Lexell, & Deierborg, 2015; Farina et al., 2014). Research has also shown that aerobic exercise can increase the integrity of white matter in neurological populations (e.g. Voss et al., 2013). Importantly, physical activity interventions can be accessible (e.g., can be completed without expensive equipment; available to diverse socioeconomic populations) and are non-invasive. To date, progressive MS has been understudied compared to other MS subtypes. This paucity of research for effective progressive MS interventions has been identified as a unmet need of the field (Metz & Liu, 2018). While there is evidence that exercise improves symptoms of MS, the neural basis of these improvements in largely unknown. Based on this, the proposed study will use Diffusion Tensor Imaging to investigate white matter integrity in individuals with progressive MS pre and post exercise intervention and how any observed white matter changes are related to changes in MS symptoms. Methods: Participants Individuals with primary or secondary progressive MS will be recruited through Island Health’s Permission to Contact Program, through which the local health authority provides information about research opportunities to interested patients as part of their care, and helps researchers connect with eligible study participants. Exclusion criteria include comorbid neurological diagnoses; conditions that wouldn’t allow engagement in walking, contraindications for MRI and current exercise regimen of more than one session per week. Participants will be randomly separated into two groups of twenty: the first group will be a no-treatment) control group and the second group will undergo an exercise intervention Exercise intervention A twelve-week exercise intervention was designed in collaboration with a faculty member in the Kinesiology department at UVic and was based on a systematically developed pilot randomized controlled trial of exercise and cognition for individuals with MS published by Sandroff and colleagues (2016). Participants in the intervention group will undergo a protocol of speeded walking three times a week. That will initially consist of 15 minutes of light to moderate intensity walking and progress over 12 weeks to 40 minutes of more intense walking exercise. All participants will wear activity monitors that will capture data on the duration and intensity of exercise over the study period. Measures Imaging Data will be acquired at the West Coast Medical Imaging (WCMI) facility located in Victoria, BC. WCMI has a 3T GE MRI Signa Pioneer Scanner with the ability to collect DTI and high-resolution anatomical data. Structural T1 images will be collected in sagittal orientation with the 3D BRAVO sequence (TR = 8600 ms, TE = 3300 ms, 194 slices, FOV: 256 x 256, voxel size 1 x 1 x 1 mm). Diffusion tensor imaging data will be collected with the following parameters: axial EPI acquisition with TR = 8000 ms, TE = 101 ms, 52 slices, voxels = 5 x 5 x 2mm. Imaging data will be collected immediately pre- and post-intervention for both groups. Symptom measures: Data on cognitive function and depressive symptoms will also be collected for all participants pre- and post-intervention using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (Parmenter, Weinstock-Guttman, Garg, Munschauer, & Benedict, 2007), Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward (Jensen & Figueroa, 1975), California Verbal Learning Test (third edition; Delis et al. 2017) and the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988). Fatigue will be assessed using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (Ritvo et al., 1997). Hypothesis: 1. Do symptoms of MS improve pre-post exercise intervention? It is expected that the groups will have similar characteristics pre intervention and that the exercise group will demonstrate significant (positive) differences from the control group on all measures, post intervention. 2. Do microstructural characteristics of white matter improve pre-post exercise intervention? FSL’s Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) will be used to derive fractional anisotropy (FA) metrics that will allow for group comparisons of white matter integrity pre and post intervention (using typical thresholds p<.05; corrected for multiple comparisons). It is expected that the groups will have no significant differences in white matter integrity pre intervention and that the intervention group will show increased white matter integrity (as evidenced by increased FA) Academic impact: This pilot study could have significant implications for the management of progressive MS. Taking a patient-oriented approach, the ultimate goal of this research is to identify neuroprotective, disease-modifying behavioural treatments (which are low cost and easily accessible) for MS that can increase quality of life and reducing the effects of this degenerative disorder on Canadians. The proposed study has the potential to stimulate future research in a number of areas, including: the investigation of other types of exercise, the use of other neuroimaging methods, and future research on the relationship between brain based changes and MS symptomology. Finally, the proposed study provides an opportunity for knowledge translation work on brain health and lifestyle factors that may influence the development of MS in a way that is accessible for all Canadians.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lesions in the central nervous system. MS is often accompanied by other symptoms including, depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Progressive MS is a subtype of MS that progresses more quickly than others, and has few or no periods of relapse. Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS, and there has been a call for the development of effective treatments for progressive MS. However, in recent years the positive benefits of exercise on MS have become apparent. Individuals with MS who report exercising frequently have reported reduced fatigue and symptoms of depression. To date, however, little is known about the changes in the brain that may accompany frequent exercise in MS. Additionally, little is known about the relationship between exercise and common secondary symptoms of MS such as fatigue and depression. Diffusion Tension imaging (DTI) is an MRI technique that is capable of detecting lesions in the white matter of the brain, which are prominent individuals with MS. DTI is easily repeatable and non-invasive, making it an ideal method to study the neuroprotective effects of exercise in individuals with MS. The proposed study will look at brain based changes in individuals with progressive MS before and after beginning an exercise intervention compared to a control group. Additionally, the proposed study will investigate how secondary symptoms of MS such as depression and fatigue are related to the brain based changes seen over the course of the study.",,"Exercise, Intervention, White Matter, Progressive",Multiple Sclerosis,n,Myelination,Exercise,Treatment,Human,"Translational, Clinical Trial",Mind and Body,University of Victoria,2019,"8,000.00","8,000.00",,,,,,,"8,000.00","8,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/walk_a_mile_to_re_myel_inate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Nicole-Grant-2267484408,https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/research/cap-lab.html,Concordia University,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jean-Philippe Miron,,Jonathan Downar,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy – The Office Edition,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with high occupational and economic impact. A significant portion of patients fail to respond to standard treatment, such as medication, and psychotherapy, with up to 50% experiencing a chronic or recurrent course, and 30 to 40% described as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Furthermore, even though antidepressants are the mainstay of psychiatric care in MDD, discontinuation rates nearing 50% after 3 months of use, chiefly because of non-response and/or side-effects, limit their real-world efficacy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MDD, with an advantageous side-effect profile over medication. It classically involves non-invasive stimulation of the prefrontal cortex through magnetic field pulses delivered by a coil at a high-frequency (HF). The antidepressant efficacy of rTMS has been affirmed in numerous large meta-analyses, consistently achieving response rates of 50-55%, and remission rates of 30-35% in TRD. Unfortunately, rTMS is burdened by high costs and the necessity for patients to travel daily for several weeks (6 weeks for a full 30 sessions course) to receive treatment, thus limiting acceptability and widespread adoption. This proposal addresses these issues by performing an open-label pilot study of 60 MDD patients using a simplified, accelerated, low- cost, and patient-delivered type of rTMS with minimal technical support, which can pave the way to inexpensive and home-based rTMS. Methods: To limit patients travels, we will perform an initial full course (30 sessions) of accelerated rTMS within a week (1st phase), and subsequently offer an additional 25 sessions of once-daily treatment for non-remitters (2nd phase). Recent studies have shown accelerated rTMS to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in MDD, while shortening treatment course. The need for additional sessions is based on recent work by our group, where four distinct response trajectories to rTMS were identified, independent of the stimulation protocol used. This analysis, that now warrants replication, showed that a considerable portion of the patients did not reach a plateau of improvement by 30 session. Thus, patients could have benefited from additional sessions to achieve full remission. Also, we will use a low-frequency (LF) stimulation protocol, that can be delivered on stimulators for a fraction of the cost than those required for HF, while retaining efficacy in the treatment of MDD. Finally, we will test a new way of delivering rTMS with minimal technical assistance using radiation therapy masks to hold the rTMS coil in place. Depression scores will be monitored using validated patient- and clinician-rated scales, and the primary outcome will be the Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II) score. In addition, we will use a simple and low-cost EEG system to obtain 16-channel recordings. EEG will be used before and after treatment to assess whether orbitofrontal low frequency band power is a correlate, and predictor of the treatment outcome, which was the case in a recent pilot study from our group. We will also include a measure of the heart rate variability (HRV), shown to be decreased in MDD at baseline, eventually increasing after successful treatment. Hypothesis: Accelerated low-frequency rTMS will be a safe, well-tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of refractory depression. Treatment will be accelerated compared to the usual once-daily rTMS. Treatment will also be better tolerated compared to conventional high-frequency rTMS. Compared to healthy controls, patients undergoing treatment will have higher baseline alpha power over right orbitofrontal cortical regions, which will correlate to the reduction in depression symptom severity following rTMS; similarly, reductions in alpha power over these regions will correlate to the reduction in depression symptom severity following rTMS. Compared to healthy controls, patients undergoing treatment will have decreased high-rate variability, which will increase with successful treatment. Academic impact: If successful, this project will pave the way to home-based rTMS at a cost comparable to medication, while retaining a lower side effect profile to improve the delivery of psychiatric care in MDD. This could potentially revolutionize the treatment guidelines, making rTMS a first-line options to patients, while sparing them the inconvenient side-effects of psychotropic medication.","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). So far, its use has been reserved for patients with refractory illness (non-responsive to medication and psychotherapy), and widespread adoption is impeded by its complexity. Indeed, rTMS currently requires high-cost equipment, continuous and one-on-one technical support, and the need for patients to travel to a treatment center daily for several weeks (usually 6 weeks for a full course of 30 sessions), limiting acceptability. These obstacles need to be addressed to democratize therapy, which is frequently sought by patients for both its lower side effect profile compared to medication and proven efficacy. We propose to conduct a trial to test a new paradigm of rTMS delivery that will lower costs, and increase simplicity, and acceptability. Firstly, we will use a low-frequency stimulation protocol that can be delivered on more affordable equipment, reducing costs to a fraction of what is usually required for classic, high-frequency rTMS, while retaining efficacy in the treatment of MDD. Secondly, we will accelerate the treatment to increase patient acceptability by providing a full course within one week. We will also offer additional sessions for participants who have only partially improved. Based on our previous work, we believe that higher improvement rates could be achieved by prolonging treatment beyond what is usually offered. Finally, we wish to test a new way of delivering rTMS, where the treatment will be delivered with minimal technical assistance, further decreasing the costs, and paving the way to home-based treatment. We believe that simplifying treatment and decreasing costs will allow widespread use of rTMS, and significantly improve the delivery of care in depression.",,"rTMS, Depression, Tolerated, Sessions",Major Depressive Disorder,y,Neuroplasticity,TMS,"Treatment, Affordability",Human,Basic,Tech,University of Toronto,2019,"22,000.00","22,000.00",,,,,,,"22,000.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/bringing_the_brain_stimulation_clinic_home_with_you,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=eS7u6mQAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-philippe-miron-774263238/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Philippe-Miron,https://providers.ucsd.edu/details/1952178196/psychiatry,UC San Diego,,,,,2,,,,,,2?,2,5?,2?,1?,1?,
Jean-Philippe Miron,,Jonathan Downar,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy – The Office Edition,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with high occupational and economic impact. A significant portion of patients fail to respond to standard treatment, such as medication, and psychotherapy, with up to 50% experiencing a chronic or recurrent course, and 30 to 40% described as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Furthermore, even though antidepressants are the mainstay of psychiatric care in MDD, discontinuation rates nearing 50% after 3 months of use, chiefly because of non-response and/or side-effects, limit their real-world efficacy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MDD, with an advantageous side-effect profile over medication.

Laavanya Dharmakulaseelan,,Mark Boulos,Speech Therapy for your throat: A Treatment for Sleep Apnea,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep due to intermittent loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle tone [1]. Approximately 72% of stroke patients have post-stroke OSA [2]. Post-stroke OSA is linked to post-stroke fatigue [3], which is a top research priority for stroke patients [4]. In addition, if left untreated, post-stroke OSA is associated with greater mortality [5], a higher risk of recurrent stroke [6], poorer cognition and lower functional status [7]. In addition, stroke patients with OSA spend significantly longer times in rehabilitation and in acute care hospitals [8]. Since OSA has a significant impact on the health of stroke patients, it is imperative that effective treatments are used to assist these individuals. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for patients with moderate to severe OSA. However, despite having been demonstrated to improve post-stroke cognition [9], motor and functional outcomes [10], and quality of life [11], CPAP adherence amongst stroke patients is poor [12]. Reasons for poor CPAP adherence are multi-factorial and often not easily modifiable [13,14]. Overall, there is a major clinical need to develop an alternative well-tolerated treatment for OSA. Oropharyngeal exercises (OPEs) are commonly used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to improve oro-motor strength and serve as a promising alternative approach to treat OSA. For example, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which patients with moderate OSA underwent 3 months of daily exercises focusing on strengthening oro-pharyngeal musculature, OSA severity and symptoms were demonstrated to be significantly reduced compared to sham exercises [15]. Similarly, use of the didgeridoo, a wind instrument that strengthens muscles of the upper airway, has also been demonstrated to reduce OSA severity [16]. In stroke, OPEs are commonly used by SLPs to improve oro-pharyngeal and tongue strength and have been reported to positively affect oro-motor and speech functions [17], as well as post- stroke dysphagia [18]. However, whether OPEs can also positively impact post-stroke OSA is yet unknown. Limited work has explored the role of OPEs as a potential alternative treatment strategy for OSA and no prior work has demonstrated feasibility of this approach in post-stroke OSA. Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility of using an oropharyngeal exercise regimen in post-stroke patients with OSA who are unable to tolerate CPAP. Methods: Study design: We will perform a randomized feasibility study involving 40-50 stroke patients with OSA (apnea- hypopnea index [AHI] >10/hr) who are unable to tolerate CPAP after a trial of CPAP. Participants will be excluded if they have the following: (i) cognitive impairment, as defined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of <18 [19]; (ii) aphasia or apraxia of speech [20]; (iii) significant depressive symptoms [21]; (iv) body mass index >40kg/m2; (v) craniofacial malformations/nasal obstruction; (vi) regular use of hypnotic medication; (vii) neuromuscular disease impacting oropharyngeal power; (viii) use of oxygen therapy or other medical device that would interfere with the use of the home sleep apnea test (HSAT); (ix) existing conditions known to compromise the accuracy of portable sleep monitoring, such as significant pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure [22]. Participants will be randomized (1:1) either to the treatment group (oropharyngeal exercises) or the control group (sham exercises). The OPE protocol for the treatment group will consist of 10 standard isometric and isotonic OPEs (e.g., press hard with your tongue against the roof of your mouth) [23], while the sham protocol for the control group will consist of simple mouth movements, which have no impact on oropharyngeal strength. Both protocols will be delivered via a tablet-based app. Participants will perform exercises for 6 weeks, 5 days per week, once daily for 30 minutes (range of 900 minutes in total). Participants will be trained to use the software to ensure good quality of video recordings, and follow up phone calls and in- house/Skype visits will be scheduled to provide re-training and troubleshoot technical issues if needed. Patients in each study arm will have the same number of pre-specified interactions with the study personnel. Outcomes: The primary outcome, feasibility of using an oropharyngeal exercise regimen in stroke patients, will be recorded (in minutes) via use of the App that will deliver the OPEs/sham exercises. Furthermore, we will track the number of eligible and recruited patients through the use of screening logs. The following secondary outcomes will be obtained at baseline, post-training (6 weeks) and retention (10 weeks): (i) OSA severity (as measured by the AHI and oxygen desaturation using HSAT) [24, 25]; (ii) oropharyngeal deficits and dysarthria, as measured by the Frenchey Dysarthria Assessment [26]; (iii) tongue/lip/jaw weakness, as measured by the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument & Flexiforce [27]; (iv) sleep-related symptoms, as assessed by standardized questionnaires [28-31]. Hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: An RCT of an oropharyngeal exercise regimen in post-stroke OSA will be feasible in that >80% of enrolled patients will complete >80% of exercises. Approach to test hypothesis 1: We will compute the mean duration (in minutes) of the OPE/sham regimen completed and compare the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval to 720 minutes of OPE/sham regimen completed, which corresponds with 80% adherence to our study intervention. Furthermore, in an exploratory fashion, we will use a linear regression model to explore whether various pre-specified predictors (i.e. age, sex, stroke severity, time from stroke onset) might be related to OPE/sham regimen completion. Hypothesis 2: Compared to the sham activities, an oropharyngeal exercise regimen may improve OSA severity, oropharyngeal physiology/function, and sleep-related symptoms. Approach to test hypothesis 2: Post-training (6 weeks) and retention (10 weeks) scores will be compared between groups (active treatment vs. sham control) using a linear regression model, adjusting for the baseline score (ANCOVA). We will take into account potentially important covariates such as age, sex, stroke severity and time since stroke. Since we will likely be underpowered to adequately explore the impact of these covariates, these will also be examined in an exploratory fashion. Academic impact: Obstructive sleep apnea has a significant impact on the health of stroke patients, but current treatment is limited by the use of CPAP, which is generally poorly tolerated. This study will be of interest to the academic community because it will explore the use of oropharyngeal exercises as a novel treatment strategy for post-stroke OSA as part of secondary stroke prevention. If a treatment regimen of oropharyngeal exercise is demonstrated to be feasible in stroke patients, subsequent studies could evaluate the efficacy of an oropharyngeal exercise regimen in treating OSA and improving clinical outcomes. Since the treatment of OSA has the potential to improve functional, motor, and cognitive outcomes, our novel approach may positively affect recovery of a wide range of functions post-stroke. This treatment strategy may also be useful in other clinical populations that are significantly impacted by obstructive sleep apnea.","Stroke is a devastating disease that can lead to permanent disabilities such as inability to speak, paralysis, and death. Many stroke patients develop obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after their stroke. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which the muscles in the throat collapse and disrupt breathing during sleep. Leaving OSA untreated can result in slower recovery of the brain after stroke and can increase the chance of another stroke. Currently, obstructive sleep apnea is treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is a treatment that involves air being used to open the airway and assist with breathing during sleep. Unfortunately, many stroke patients cannot tolerate this treatment. In order to help these individuals who cannot tolerate CPAP, we would like to study the effect of a new exercise-based treatment in the management of obstructive sleep apnea in stroke patients. We think that strengthening the muscles in the throat will prevent them from collapsing during sleep and therefore treat OSA.

Claire Niehaus,,Robbin Gibb,Helping Hands: Exploring the Effects of Cannabis on Neuroinflammation and Stroke Recovery,"Background: With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, there is now, more than ever an urgent need for science research into the cellular, molecular, neuroanatomical, and possible medicinal effects of cannabis. With legal limitations lifted, different cannabis strains are beginning to emerge, each with unique levels of major cannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Many of these different cannabis products claim to have a diverse range of health benefits such as minimizing inflammation and reducing pain. 1,2 Specifically, it is believed that CBD is the molecule responsible for many of these proposed therapeutic effects. 2 The prospect of using cannabis as a form of alternative therapy to traditional medicines is quite appealing to many people suffering with chronic diseases. This research project is seeking to understand if these therapeutic effects may be put to use as a treatment in mediating the effects of stroke. Strokes are the third largest cause of death in Canada, and the rate of strokes occurring in young adults has been rising steadily since the start of the millennium. 3,4 The neuroinflammatory response that follows an ischemic event is often responsible for extensive tissue damage. This begs the question: would mediating the neuron- inflammatory response following an ischemic event serve to limit the extent of damage to the brain and therefore mediate some of the detrimental behavioural and cognitive effects of ischemic stroke? The stroke model I will be following involves creating a motor cortex lesion using a pial strip method. This model has been used extensively in our lab and the behavioural and cognitive effects of this lesion have been replicated with confidence. The research project for which I am seeking funding will be divided into two parts. First, in the pilot study, I will assess the molecular, behavioural, and neuroanatomical effects of different cannabis extracts using an in vivo rodent model. Secondly, I will apply those findings to understand the possible effects of high- CBD cannabis extract in mediating the effects of neuroinflammation caused by stroke. Methods: Pilot Study The pilot study will be divided into two cohorts of animals. The first cohort will test two different extracts at two doses (10mg/kg and 40 mg/kg). Each group will consist of 14 male and 14 female Long-Evans rats receiving one dose of one extract, as well as 14 controls for a total of 140 animals. Animals will be put through a behavioural test battery sensitive to prefrontal and/or hippocampal changes in early life and adolescence prior to drug exposure to ensure typical behavioural development. Early behavioural tests include negative geotaxis (Post- natal day 9-10), a measure of sensorimotor development, and open field (P10-15), a measure of exploratory behaviour. Adolescent tests include activity box (P35) to measure exploratory behaviour, and elevated plus maze (P36), which assesses anxiety. At P80, all animals will receive the appropriate extract administered orally for 10 days. 1 day following treatment, 4 males and 4 females/group will be euthanized to conduct molecular and immunological analysis. The final 10 males and 10 females/group will undergo adult behavioural testing. Adult tests include activity box (P91), elevated plus maze (P92), Whishaw tray reaching (P96-117) to assess fine motor function, and Morris water task (P118-123) to measure spatial learning and memory. Following adult behaviour, 4 animals/group will be euthanized for molecular analysis and the final 6 animals will be perfused for neuroanatomical analysis. Golgi-Cox stained coronal sections will be used to measure the morphology of pyramidal neurons. The second cohort of animals will follow the identical methodology with two new cannabis extracts. Once all the data has been collected, the extract with the highest CBD content and least effect on brain and behaviour will be used in the stroke model. Stroke Study Three cohorts, each of 12 male and 12 female adult Long-Evans rats will be utilized. The first cohort will receive the extract for t days prior to the lesion. The second cohort will receive the extract for 10 days immediately following the lesion. The third cohort will receive the extract for 10 days, 10 days after receiving the lesion. A control group will receive only the lesion, for a total of 96 animals. Following the lesion/treatment the animals will be put through the adult test battery outlined above. 4 male and 4 female animals of each cohort will be euthanized for molecular analysis and 8 male and 8 female per group will be perfused for neuroanatomical analysis. Hypothesis: There are two main hypotheses concerning this proposed research project. Firstly, I hypothesize that these high CBD, low THC, strains will not exert any negative effect on the brain and/or behaviour. Secondly, I hypothesize that cannabis exposure will limit the neuroinflammation caused by the stroke thereby mitigating potential negative effects. Academic impact: Broadening the literature regarding the effects of different strains of cannabis is a much-needed resource as research on this specific topic is lacking. The pilot study of this project will do just that and examine the molecular, behavioural, and neuroanatomical effects of CBD extracts on the central nervous system. This basic science research will be able serve as a backbone from which other research can then develop. If we are able to confirm, as predicted, that high CBD, low THC cannabis extracts will have little to no effect on the brain and behaviour of animals receiving the drug, we may then really be able to explore broader medical applications of CBD extracts. Applying the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD extract as a treatment for neuroinflammation will also have a wide range of scientific applications. If we determine that high CBD cannabis extract is an effective therapy for minimizing neuroinflammation caused by stroke, those principles may then be applied to other diseases of the brain characterized by neuroinflammation, such as multiple sclerosis.","Following its recent legalization in Canada, it seems that cannabis is the hot topic of conversation both in popular culture and around the dinner table. The conversation surrounding medical cannabis use has been a controversial one for many years. Despite this, over the past several years the number of people in Canada who use cannabis for medical purposes has sky rocketed. 5 This research project will explore the ability of cannabis extracts high in CBD (the compound responsible for many of the medical benefits of cannabis such as pain reduction) to treat the inflammation in the brain that is caused as a result of having suffered a stroke. Before we are able to consider any medical application of cannabis extract we will first need to ensure that it does not have any sort of negative effect on the brain or significantly alter behaviour. After all, treatment should ideally treat the medical issue with limited side effects. Once we are confident that cannabis extracts high in CBD do not have any major negative effects on the nervous system, we will then begin to examine their possible use in treating inflammation of brain caused by stroke thereby limiting any negative effects caused by the stroke.

Claire Niehaus,,Robbin Gibb,Helping Hands: Exploring the Effects of Cannabis on Neuroinflammation and Stroke Recovery,"Background: With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, there is now, more than ever an urgent need for science research into the cellular, molecular, neuroanatomical, and possible medicinal effects of cannabis. With legal limitations lifted, different cannabis strains are beginning to emerge, each with unique levels of major cannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Many of these different cannabis products claim to have a diverse range of health benefits such as minimizing inflammation and reducing pain. 1,2 Specifically, it is believed that CBD is the molecule responsible for many of these proposed therapeutic effects. 2 The prospect of using cannabis as a form of alternative therapy to traditional medicines is quite appealing to many people suffering with chronic diseases.

"Robin Green, Asaf Gilboa",,"Robin Green, Asaf Gilboa","If you have MS, turning off Google Maps Directions could help with Memory Problems","Background: Canada has one of the highest rates of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the world, with an estimated 93,500 Canadians living with the disease (1). It is currently an incurable, chronic disease associated with progressive neurodegeneration of the brain’s structures, and debilitating physical symptoms such as numbness, chronic pain, fatigue, vision and balance problems (1). As many as 75% of all MS patients also suffer from cognitive impairment (2-4) in the domains of attention (5-6), information processing efficiency (5,7,8) executive functions (9-11), processing speed and episodic memory (2, 12). Cognition is important in maintaining one’s quality of life, well-being, independence and participation in the community (12). Unfortunately, cognitive symptoms in MS are often hidden by more visible deficits (e.g., motor, sensory, cerebellar) and may be overshadowed by fatigue, pain and/or emotional complaints like depression, making their detection more difficult for clinicians (13). Even when detected, due to the dearth of existing therapies to help improve memory, cognitive impairment is difficult to treat and makes MS patients under-recognized and therefore under-treated and under-researched by clinicians and scientists (14). Recent research has effectively used neuroimaging techniques to document anatomical changes in the brain associated with cognitive deficits in both relapse-remitting and progressive types of MS. Neurodegeneration of the hippocampus, a critical structure in new memory formation and learning, has been reported in MS patients using MRI and has been correlated with both global cognitive impairment and impairment on specific cognitive tests, mostly in the domain of memory (15-19). For instance, Sicotte and colleagues (2008) were one of the first groups to show hippocampal volume loss related to worsening verbal memory, as measured by performance on the word-pair learning task (20). Gonzalez Torre and colleagues (2017), using a more comprehensive battery of memory assessments, identified asymmetrical hippocampal volume loss in MS patients; they observed that only the left hippocampal volume correlated with deficits in episodic memory (21). Using DTI imaging, decreased white matter integrity in the fornix positively correlated with hippocampal volume loss in 53 MS patients, which was associated with poor episodic memory performance, attention and speed of processing as compared to 20 healthy adults (22). Moreover, compelling evidence suggests hippocampal atrophy may begin early, prior to diagnosis (17, 20, 23). A longitudinal study showed that hippocampal atrophy occurs 2-6 months following a Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), which is the first neurological episode predictive of future MS diagnosis (24). Volume loss was observed to begin in the CA4/dentate gyrus subfield and within a year progressively and globally spread to the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus (24). These volume losses presented themselves behaviorally through poorer performance on the pattern separation task at baseline (25) and deficits in episodic verbal memory 1 year later (24). The same study also found lower dentate gyrus volume at baseline is predictive of CA1 region and whole hippocampal volumes a year later (24). Several mechanisms have been advanced for this deterioration including down-regulation of trophic factors (insulin-like growth factor 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor), reduced angiogenesis and neurogenesis as a consequence of neuroinflammation (14, 22). These findings are discouraging - especially for a relatively young clinical population with long survival expectancy – and given the deleterious impact of reduced hippocampal volume for memory and consequent every-day functioning (e.g., work, school, independence) (26-29). On the other hand, this discovery opens promising new avenues for intervention. If we can offset degeneration, we may be able to considerably attenuate disability. Current research in MS on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation therapies is in its infancy, with few studies using MRI to monitor resulting structural brain benefits (14, 30). One study has conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of a behavioural intervention based on the modified Story Memory Technique, which teaches patients how to use imagery and context to facilitate learning (31). While completion of the intervention elicited improvements in learning and memory (based on a list-learning paradigm) and produced favourable changes on the neurofunctional level (i.e. increased activity of key neural networks involved in memory and learning), it is unclear if such benefits are generalizeable to a person’s everyday life and whether there were any beneficial neuroanatomical changes. The study at hand examines a therapeutic behavioural intervention based on the Environmental Enrichment (EE) model, which posits that continuously novel, challenging, complex and engaging cognitive stimulation can have beneficial effects on the brain (32). A very promising type of environmental enrichment employs allocentric (i.e., “bird’s eye” view) visuospatial navigation. Many studies from our group and elsewhere have shown that allocentric spatial navigation tasks protect the hippocampi (33, 34). For instance, individuals who spontaneously engage in allocentric spatial navigation have been shown to have larger hippocampi (which confers resilience against neurodegeneration) as well as improved memory and other cognitive functions (e.g. executive functioning and processing speed) (35). In a seminal study, Lovden and colleagues (2012) showed that healthy younger and older adults who underwent an intensive allocentric spatial navigation intervention exhibited reduced aging-related hippocampal atrophy and improved memory function after 16 weeks of treatment compared to controls (36). Modeled after the aforementioned study, our lab developed an online allocentric spatial navigation intervention designed to improve memory and prevent hippocampal atrophy. While originally designed to benefit memory and learning in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (m-sTBI), who notably also suffer from memory deficits associated with progressive hippocampal atrophy, this intervention may be extended to those with MS. It should be noted that commercial brain-training software purported to enhance cognitive functioning have been challenged by the scientific community (37). While we employ a typical brain-game approach (e.g., engaging tasks and rewards to encourage ongoing participation), we use highly targeted cognitive stimulation (allocentric navigation) known to specifically induce hippocampal neuroplastic changes when delivered at sufficiently high intensity. Our unpublished preliminary data with brain injury patients (N=9 m-sTBI, N=10 healthy controls) shows support for its behavioural efficacy. We have yet to examine the intervention in people with MS. Specific Aims and Hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the efficacy of a novel, self-administered behavioural intervention for improving memory and every-day functioning, and for reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS. This will be achieved by administering our intervention to the treatment group and no intervention to the control group. Pre- and post-treatment, we will undertake (i) neuropsychological tests measuring near transfer (i.e., benefits on materials used in training), far transfer (i.e., benefits on materials that differ from the training materials) and everyday memory outcomes, and (ii) neuroimaging of the hippocampi. The allocentric spatial navigation group will be compared to the control group. Hypothesis 1: Patients in the targeted, spatial navigation group as compared to the control group will show (i) greater improvements in memory, (ii) lesser hippocampal atrophy, (iii) improved every-day functioning. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of a self-administered, remotely-delivered intervention; this includes the feasibility of (i) completing the full, 16-week intervention, and (ii) completing the weekly and pre- and post-outcome measurements for the study. This will be achieved by assessing recruitment and retention in the study, and by measuring compliance of patients in the completion of the interventions and the completion of all behavioural outcome measures of the study. Methods: Overview: Sixty MS patients is the sample size of the study. 50 patients will be recruited, factoring in approximately 20% attrition rate. Patients will range in age from 18 to 55 (upper limit set to avoid age-related cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy) and will be recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute at the University Health Network through referrals made by a physiatrist on staff and our collaborator. Inclusion criteria consist of a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis and self-reported memory concern. Key exclusion criteria are: exacerbation/pseudo-relapse in the last 4 weeks, active psychosis or unmanaged depression, other neurological disorders (e.g. stroke, dementia, cerebral palsy) and systemic comorbidity (e.g. lupus, diabetes). Specifically progressive (both primary and secondary) form rather than relapse-remitting MS was chosen for this study because the latter is predominantly characterized by neuroinflammation, whereas the former is more characterized by neurodegeneration and closer aligns with the focus of our intervention (14). Intervention protocol: This pre- vs. post, between-groups randomized control trial consists of 2 arms: treatment and no treatment control. Half of the MS patients will be randomized to the treatment arm, a 16-week novel intervention will be administered remotely to patients with progressive MS in their homes on their computers. The intervention employs a Google Streetview (GSV) platform to navigate cities, using real-world routes with multiple turns, and tracking of distance-to-destinations to challenge hippocampal function (38). The other half of the MS patients will be randomized into a no treatment control. Here, participants will not complete the intervention, and we will rather observe changes in their memory and hippocampal volumes during the 4 month period. The intervention will be administered remotely to the former group, requiring one hour of training, 5 days/week (either on consecutive days or alternating). All participants will undergo pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment behavioural assessments. A randomly-chosen subset of 24 participants (12 per group) will undergo pre- and post-intervention MRI imaging at the University of Toronto in addition to the behavioural assessments (the rest will be randomized to cognitive outcomes only) for the efficacy component of the study (N.b., we are collecting imaging on the subset to work within the constraints of the budget). At the end of the study, all participants and their care-givers will also be invited for semi-structured clinical interviews to ascertain their experience with the intervention. The intervention duration, dose and outcome measurement timelines (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 4 month follow-up) map onto the key study by Lovden and colleagues (36), whose allocentric spatial navigation intervention offset hippocampal atrophy in healthy young and older adults. This will allow for comparison to previous research as well as ongoing research investigating efficacy of this intervention in brain injury patients. Efficacy Outcomes: Imaging (Preliminary efficacy): We will collect pilot efficacy data to ascertain an effect size for a larger imaging study. Our protocol will allow us to observe structural changes to the hippocampus and the integrity of associated white matter. Volumetric and DTI are used as primary outcomes for analyses (see appendix in the references section for acquisition parameters and possessing). Cognitive: Two broad types of outcomes will be employed, near transfer (intervention-specific modalities) and far transfer (modalities outside of the intervention). Near Transfer effects will be measured by spatial navigational abilities. These 4 spatial navigation outcomes comprise “unlearnt” versions of the training tasks. (i) Map drawing- participants will reproduce the configuration of spatial elements of a studied area (streets, landmarks) in a sketch map. Number and positioning of streets and landmarks and the general orientation of the map are scored. (ii) Vector mapping- participants choose from a 360 degree circle and provide the direction from their current position to previously learned landmarks. (iii) Proximity judgments- stimation of which of two landmarks is closer to current location. (iv) Blocked-route navigation- participants describe the most efficient route from one specified landmark to another given that the street vital to taking the most direct route was inaccessible. Far transfer effects will be measured by (i) Pattern separation (differentiating memories to prevent interference from overlapping details): Virtual navigation can generalize to improved pattern separation as tested by Mnemonic Similarity Task (39, 40) a task selectively sensitive to hippocampal damage, entailing use of highly similar lure items after a study exposure and activates both dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA3 neurons (41) (ii) Pattern completion- we will use the Memory Image Completion task (39,42) designed to probe pattern completion. This is a test measuring non-verbal reasoning by asking the participant to choose an option which completes an image with a missing piece best. (iii) Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT-3) (43). This is a functional memory test with strong psychometric properties including ecological validity. (iv) Everyday Memory Questionnaire (44) - This is a 28-item patient-reported outcome questionnaire with strong psychometric properties and convergence validity with the RBMT-3. The test comprises statements regarding forgetting things and patients indicate how frequently the examples have occurred over the past month. All of the above mentioned measures have been validated in literature (as indicated in references) and are commonly used by neuropsychologists in research and clinical care, which will allow us to compare our results and allow for more efficient knowledge translation. Feasibility outcomes: Feasibility will be measured by (i) Recruitment rate: the number of patients consented/number of eligible patients approached. (ii) Retention rate: the number of consented patients at baseline/the number of consented patients retained at follow-up. Factors influencing retention (e.g., medical status) will be reported as percentages. (iii) Compliance rate: percentage of patients adhering to at least 80% of the training protocol. Compliance rates to be computed for individual participants weekly, and for full cohort at end of study. (iv) Compliance: patient reported outcome. This is a questionnaire developed by our group that requires under a minute to complete, asking participants to self-report how much of the day’s exercise they were able to complete and how difficult they found it. (v) Patient burden: measured using “How much is too much scale”. This measure was developed by our group (45), it quantifies a patient’s experience of cognitive, somatic and emotional burden in response to completing a cognitive intervention, and will be completed monthly. (vi) Completion rate of outcome measures: number of outcome measures completed/number of outcome measures included in the study. Completion rates to be computed for the suite of neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures. Factors influencing recruitment, retention and completion will be documented and reported as percentages. Post intervention, semi-structured interview: a patient and care-giver interviews developed for the purpose of this study will be undertaken to ascertain retention and compliance barriers. Following the recent precedent of a large-scale caregiver burden study (46), we will also measure psychological well- being of care-givers who agree to do the interview employing the 10-item Positive Affect Scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (47), and physical and mental health (according to the scores on the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item ShortForm Health Survey) (48, 49).","Background: Canada has one of the highest rates of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the world. Patients with MS endure a range of debilitating symptoms, including memory impairment. In fact, as many as 75% of all patients experience memory problems. In addition to the challenges of fatigue, pain, vision impairment and balance deficits, memory impairment is itself debilitating, making participation in work, school and social life even more difficult. The ""hippocampus"", a key brain area for memory, navigating and decision-making, is often compromised in patients with MS. Its progressive shrinking (aka neurodegeneration) can even precede diagnosis of MS. Our study: Encouragingly, there is a promising behavioural intervention for arresting this shrinkage, and for improving memory function and brain health. The intervention entails engagement in continuous and challenging spatial navigation, involving the learning of new routes of cities, and making a map in one's head of those routes. Based on past research, we have developed an intervention in which people engage in these activities for an hour every other day for 16 weeks, and they get rewards along the way to make it more fun. We have designed the therapy so that people can do these cognitive exercises on their computers at home using a popular program called “Google Streetview”. In our proposed study, the first aim is to prove the benefits of this intervention for improving memory and brain function, and to demonstrate that these benefits are relevant to a person's every-day life. Our second aim is to develop the best strategies for delivering this therapy to patients across the province, by gaining a better understanding of barriers to engaging in and complying with such remotely delivered therapies. For this second aim, we will talk to both patients and family caregivers. Family caregivers can play an essential role in helping patients to engage in therapy at home. An important aspect of our intervention is that it is intended to restore hippocampal health. Most memory treatments involve “compensation” (e.g., using strategies such as imagery or note-taking to facilitate learning and memory), but this approach is known to lack effectiveness in every day life. Our study branches out by focusing on hippocampal repair; by improving the health and functioning of the hippocampus, the benefits of treatment stand to extend more readily to a person’s everyday life. Impact: If successful, our study would improve the brain, memory and everyday functioning of people with MS. The intervention will reach patients regardless of where they live and of any physical or financial barriers that might preclude travel to a treatment. Finally, the intervention is scalable and cost effective because it is self-administered. In short, we hope to develop a new and cost-free memory/brain treatment for patients across the province that will help to lessen the existing gap in effective remedial cognitive therapies for MS.",,"Intervention, Memory, Hippocampal, Cognitive, Navigation",Multiple Sclerosis,n,Neuroplasticity,Cognitive Training,Mobility,Human,"Translational, Clinical Trial","Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2019,"50,000.00","48,270.00",,,,,,,"48,270.00","50,000.00",Seed,Seed,https://www.branchoutfoundation.com/counterintuitive_learning_to_navigate_a_city_but_reducing_memory_symptoms,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=L_oHEXoAAAAJ ,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-green-70888a300 , ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin-Green-3 , https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Asaf-Gilboa ","https://www.cognitiveneurorehablab.ca/ , https://www.gilboalab.ca/ ",University of Toronto,"University Health Network, Baycrest",,,"robin.green@uhn.ca, agilboa@research.baycrest.org",0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sunny Bui,,Sally Lindsay,Lego: Building Better Social Connections and STEM Skills,"Background: There is a large gap in the increasing number of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and a low percentage of under-represented groups (i.e. women and people with disabilities) who are attaining degrees in these fields and participating in the workforce. (1)(2) Although the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act guarantees equality and the absence of discrimination, people with disabilities encounter barriers to post- secondary education in STEM fields. (3)(4) Resulting in a lower representation of individuals with disabilities in the STEM work-force. (5) However, it is important to recognize that some disabilities are more abled than others to perform at the level needed in the STEM workforce. Specifically, those diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disability such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual delay (ID) and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Among the most under-represented in STEM education and employment are individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities. (6) Individuals with a neurodevelopmental disability often face difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships as a result of atypical behaviour resultant of their condition and poor social learning opportunities. (7) There exist several interventions that focus on the behavioural correction such as applied behavioural analysis and therapy commonly used amongst children and youth with ASD. Applied behavioural analysis and therapy have proven to be an effective mechanism to help with behavioural correction (e.g. social skills) but do not provide a promising pathway to social integration amongst peers and future colleagues. (8) As a result, there still exists poor social learning opportunities for children and youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities to learn about socially acceptable behaviour in an environment amongst their peers. Resulting in the development of poor social skills and behaviours that are crucial in educational and employment success in the future (9). There is a growing emphasis in behavioural psychology and vocational rehabilitation research literature to utilize recreational and leisurely activities to help the development of social skills amongst youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities. (10)(11) A promising mechanism to enhance enrollment in STEM fields for youth with neurodevelopmental disability is through robotics programs. (12) Among typically developing children, robotics programs have the potential to improve STEM-related skills, teamwork, self-confidence, and social and communication skills. (13) (14) Although there is growth in literature on the potential role of robotics programs, such as LEGO therapy, little is known about the impact of an adapted, group-based robotics program specifically for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. (1)(12)(15) Furthermore, enhancing the social development of youth with a neurodevelopmental disability is important because they often have limited opportunities to interact with peers which can lead to social isolation and low self- esteem. Providing an environment that helps facilitate social skills learning and where youth with a neurodevelopmental disability can explore their interests are essential to addressing the underrepresentation and of people with disabilities in STEM education and employment. Methods: My quantitative research project will utilize a descriptive research design that will utilize qualitative coding. The study design will utilize a single group pretest-posttest survey design and recruit a purposive sample of 25 youth. Recruitment will consist of accessing the electronic health records at Holland-Bloorview Kid's Rehabilitation Hospital and cold call potential participants that fit the inclusion criteria; aged 9-14 with a neurodevelopmental disability (ASD, ID, etc). Additional methods will consist of email outreach, posters, online advertisements and word of mouth through hospital staff. Potential participants will be screened for the inclusion criteria. Upon receiving parent consent and youth assent. Participants will enroll in the HB FIRST® robotics program for 6 sessions (once per week for 2 hours) and be video-recorded while engaging in group-play, teamwork, learning about computer programming and building robots. Participants will be paired and assigned a trained volunteer to assist in teaching coding and building the robot. The first (time 1) and last (time 2) recorded videos of each participant will undergo observational analysis for social skills using the adapted version of the Test of Playfulness (ToP), a norm and criterion referenced standardized test. (16) The items of interest in the adapted version of the test are initiating, negotiating, sharing, supporting, engagement, involvement, interacting, giving and responding verbally or non-verbally. (17) To avoid saturation of the items of interest, the first and last 10 minutes of time 1 and time 2 will only be coded. (18) The primary reason for this is because social skills are developed throughout time and the learning process that occurs is during the session. Concrete measurable social behaviours will not be distinguishable during the learning process, however they will become more prevalent towards the end of the working session. Coding the entire videos will have the same value as coding the first and last ten minutes of the sessions. A coding team will be used to validate the ToP scores. An Inter-rater reliability of 0.7 will be sufficient in establishing valid ToP scores. (19) An average of the ToP items of interest between bother coders will be entered into SPSS. Paired sample t-tests will be used to assess the differences from time 1 and 2 for ToP scores with an alpha of 0.05. Quantitative data will undergo statistical analysis to determine statistical significance of the assessments items of interest. For further analysis, data will be stratified by gender, type of disability and age to compare and contrast. Hypothesis: The research question that will guide my literature search and review for my thesis will be, ""Does enrolling youth with a neurodevelopmental disability, aged 9 to 14 in an adapted robotics program provide a mechanism to optimize the development of the social skills?"" Which in turn leads me to the main objective of my study which is to to evaluate the effectiveness of using a group-based adapted robotics program as a vocational rehabilitative mechanism for improving social skills amongst youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. There as increasing focus in vocational rehabilitation research to utilize recreational and leisurely activities to stimulate learning during critical periods of brain development (i.e. puberty) for youth with or without a disability. (10)(11)(20). In addition, robotics programs have proven to improve social skills amongst youth with or without a disability. (12)(13). Thus, I hypothesize that the adapted robotics program will improve scores related to social skills from the start (time 1) of the program and end of the program (time 2). This hypothesis will help guide my statistical analysis and define my null and alternative hypothesis. Academic impact: The proposed thesis will build off an existing pilot study and scoping review conducted by the Transitions and Inclusive Environments Lab (TRAIL) lab group; using the Holland-Bloorview (HB) FIRST® Lego robotics program to enhance interest in STEM and improve social skills for children & youth with disabilities (1)(12). The proposed study’s objective will focus on the impact of an adapted robotics program on social skills specifically for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. This study will build on existing research on education and employment among youth with disabilities previously conducted by the TRAIL lab, such as: the effect of mentoring to improve transition to employment, disability disclosure in post-secondary education or employment and the benefits of hiring people with disabilities. (21)(22)(23)(24) The adapted robotics program has the potential to be an effective vocational rehabilitative mechanism to address the internal (i.e. communication, problem solving) and in turn the external (i.e. post-secondary education, employability) challenges youth with a neurodevelopmental disability encounter. My study will provide a deeper understanding in utilizing a setting where youth with a neurodevelopmental disability can explore their interests (in STEM, robotics) to drive the development of soft skills necessary for success in post-secondary education and employment. In turn, further narrowing the gap between the underrepresentation of people with ASD in post-secondary and the STEM workforce. My research will impact the academic community in two ways. Firstly, it will contribute to the research literature for using recreational or leisurely programs to help develop transferable skills amongst youth with disabilities. In addition, it will provide a forum to explore their interest in STEM and as a potential occupation in the life course. Leading to my second point, which in turn will improve the diversity of future post-secondary enrollment and in the work-force. Through my research, I hope to display the complementary and alternative intervention possibilities for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability.","Neurodevelopmental disabilities are typically characterized abnormal and/or involuntary body movements, difficulties in behaviours and a lower intelligence scores. These aspects often result in youth with a neurodevelopmental disability to be placed in separate classes than their typical developing peers, excluded peer activities, and are less likely to be hired by future employers throughout the life span. There is an increasing amount of research literature focusing on improving the peer interactions, peer relationships and employment success of youth with a neurodevelopmental disability through various services and programs. Most youth with a neurodevelopmental disability receive special assistance through educational, medical and social services, however, these resources become limited or require (additional) funding when they turn 19 years old. Hence, it is important to properly prepare youth with a neurodevelopmental disability with the skills necessary to be self-sustainable in later life. Promising careers for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability involve using their interests to help drive learning during periods of critical brain development. Robotics offers an ideal pathway for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability to explore their interests while at the same time aiding in brain development. As Farr’s theory states, computer programming may be advantageous to children with disabilities because the immediate stress by solely interacting with peers is largely removed. Computer programming provides a medium to enrich peer support and social interactions. Through this mechanism careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) may ideal for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. Thus a program that equips youth with a neurodevelopmental disability with the skills (e.g. social skills) needed to success it STEM careers is required. By enrolling youth with a neurodevelopmental disability into an adapted Lego robotics program, this study will investigate the use of the program to improve social skills by providing an environment where participants can explore their interests in robotics. Participants will engage in teamwork, learn about computer programming and build robots. While paired with a trained volunteer and another participant, capacity of social skills will be measured amongst participants in the 6-week program. This study will address the characteristics associated with neurodevelopmental conditions through the adapted robotics program. Increased knowledge on the use of an adapted Lego robotics program will provide a better understanding how to improve the social skills amongst youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. In addition, it will provide a tangible pathway to for future programs to consider the exploration of interests of youth with a neurodevelopmental disability to help drive brain development during critical periods (i.e. puberty). Furthermore, this study can provide a mechanism to enhance enrolment of youth with a neurodevelopmental disability into STEM post-secondary education or training and the work-force.

Sunny Bui,,Sally Lindsay,Lego: Building Better Social Connections and STEM Skills,"Background: There is a large gap in the increasing number of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and a low percentage of under-represented groups (i.e. women and people with disabilities) who are attaining degrees in these fields and participating in the workforce. (1)(2) Although the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act guarantees equality and the absence of discrimination, people with disabilities encounter barriers to post- secondary education in STEM fields. (3)(4) Resulting in a lower representation of individuals with disabilities in the STEM work-force. (5) However, it is important to recognize that some disabilities are more abled than others to perform at the level needed in the STEM workforce. Specifically, those diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disability such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual delay (ID) and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Among the most under-represented in STEM education and employment are individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities. (6) Individuals with a neurodevelopmental disability often face difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships as a result of atypical behaviour resultant of their condition and poor social learning opportunities. (7) There exist several interventions that focus on the behavioural correction such as applied behavioural analysis and therapy commonly used amongst children and youth with ASD. Applied behavioural analysis and therapy have proven to be an effective mechanism to help with behavioural correction (e.g. social skills) but do not provide a promising pathway to social integration amongst peers and future colleagues. (8) As a result, there still exists poor social learning opportunities for children and youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities to learn about socially acceptable behaviour in an environment amongst their peers. Resulting in the development of poor social skills and behaviours that are crucial in educational and employment success in the future (9). There is a growing emphasis in behavioural psychology and vocational rehabilitation research literature to utilize recreational and leisurely activities to help the development of social skills amongst youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities. (10)(11) A promising mechanism to enhance enrollment in STEM fields for youth with neurodevelopmental disability is through robotics programs. (12) Among typically developing children, robotics programs have the potential to improve STEM-related skills, teamwork, self-confidence, and social and communication skills. (13) (14) Although there is growth in literature on the potential role of robotics programs, such as LEGO therapy, little is known about the impact of an adapted, group-based robotics program specifically for youth with a neurodevelopmental disability. (1)(12)(15) Furthermore, enhancing the social development of youth with a neurodevelopmental disability is important because they often have limited opportunities to interact with peers which can lead to social isolation and low self- esteem. Providing an environment that helps facilitate social skills learning and where youth with a neurodevelopmental disability can explore their interests are essential to addressing the underrepresentation and of people with disabilities in STEM education and employment.

Kelvin Jones,,Darlene Auger,Brain and Body Oscillation Entrainment During Wîwîp’son- Community Engagement,"The Nehiyaw (Cree) people used a hammock-like swing as part of their traditional parenting practice to lull little ones to sleep and nurture these gifts from Creator (Auger, 2017). Following colonial contact, traditional parenting was supplanted by assimilation practices and laws. Institutionalization of generations of Aboriginal people in Canada deprived them of wholesome parenting and healing, contributing to the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities especially in the areas of mental health and chronic disease (TRCC-V1, 2015). Nearly twenty years ago Darlene Auger was gifted with a vision that the people needed to be swung, not just the little ones but also those for whom the history and legacy of colonial institutionalization had left scars that required healing. Thus began the recent history of Wîwîp’son - the healing swing (Auger, 2017). Dr Auger has offered swing therapy at many events in Treaty 6, 7 & 8 territory and has helped set up swing therapy in schools. This past year has resulted in a pause for much of this work but over the summer and into the fall, Darlene will begin engaging with First Nations communities in Alberta to offer access to swing therapy and teaching about it. I have partnered with Dr Auger to help bring her conception of monitoring the brain, heart and breath to her therapeutic sessions and also as a means of demonstrating that Indigenous values and ways of knowing can coexist equally with Western epistemologies and science. I have previously used this technology together with Dr Timothy Shantz in a project with the Spiritus Chamber Choir in a concert and performance at Beakerhead in Calgary in 2018. In that project we displayed breathing, heart rate and EEG simultaneously as a backdrop during choral performance with pauses to explain the nature of the data and its relation to singing. We envision a similar outreach to the communities Darlene works with coupled with the opportunity for people to wear the devices and see and experience the inner rhythms of their brain, heart and breath.",,,,,,,,,,,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Alberta,2021,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=f-Ue4wsAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-jones-867a64227/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kelvin-Jones-3,,University of Alberta,,,,kejones@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jacob Koudys,,Anthony C. Ruocco,"The road to personalized suicide assessment: Diversifying the “suicidal brain” by establishing its distinct clinical, behavioural, and neurophysiological signatures","Background Suicide is a public health epidemic[1]. Unfortunately, meta-analysis of the past 50 years of suicide research reveals that our ability to predict suicidal thoughts and behaviours is only marginally better than chance[2]. In contemporary research, the ideation-to-action framework of suicide emphasizes the importance of understanding what causes suicidal ideation and what mobilizes ideation into suicide attempts. However, this approach assumes a single pathway to suicide[3,4]. Challenging the ideation-to-action framework, Bernanke and colleagues[5] propose two suicide subtypes. These subtypes differ based on mood reactivity, cortisol response, cognitive control, numbers of suicide attempts, attempt lethality, and attempt impulsivity. Despite significant differences between ideators and attempters in response inhibition and decision-making[6], recent suicide theory exploring nonlinear changes processes and affective control in suicide[7,8] suggests that some suicide attempts are planful while others are highly influenced by acute affective state. Indeed, suicide attempters actively escape aversive states and have low negative social feedback tolerance compared to psychiatric controls[9,10], but these specific differences are not well borne out for comparisons of ideators and attempters. Elucidating the role of decision-making bias in suicide, neuroimaging studies indicate the importance of understanding prefrontal activation during social exclusion[11,12]. Furthermore, activation of the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is altered in suicide, and these structures belong to networks responsible for switching between dorsal and ventral prefrontal systems that govern cognitive inhibition, switching, decision- making, and planning[13]. Indeed, resting-state functional connectivity successfully classifies psychiatric inpatients with and without suicidal behaviour[14]. As such, the primary aim of this study is to explore classification schemes for suicidal individuals that will establish personalized profiles of suicide risk. This study will leverage the specificity of resting-state salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and executive control network (ECN) biomarkers and combine them with interpersonal decision-making and affective impulsivity parameters. In particular, the interpersonal decision-making task will computationally model preferences for how one explores and exploits environments with cooperative and rejecting individuals. Method Participants. One-hundred-and-fifty right-handed, English-speaking participants aged 18-55 will be recruited through Dr. Ruocco’s Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory research registry and local outpatient clinics. As part of a larger research study, 75 participants with current major depressive disorder (MDD) and 75 with comorbid MDD and borderline personality disorder will be recruited. One hundred participants with historical suicidal ideation will be recruited and 50 participants will also have historical suicide attempt. Diagnostic status will be assessed using the SCID-5 and SCID-5-PD[15,16]. Participants with neurodevelopmental disorder, endocrine disorder, significant head trauma, lifetime psychotic disorder, current substance use disorder, or an inability to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be excluded. Procedure. Most testing will occur remotely, and MRI will take place at the Toronto Neuroimaging Facility. Diagnostic interviews, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale[17], Short UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P)[18], Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief Form Plus (PID5BF+) [19], and a novel social rejection task will be administered. In the social rejection task, participants will interact with four other pairs of players (i.e., four programmed algorithms). Four Cyberball[20] environments will be presented simultaneously and the participant will move freely between the four pairs, thus giving them agency to “exploit” a pair by continuing to interact with them or “explore” another pair. Two pairs will be programmed as inclusive, and two pairs will tend toward rejection. Data Processing. rs-fMRI data will be preprocessed per specific guidelines[21-23] and processed using Ordaz and colleagues’[24] pipeline. Using FSL MELODIC[25], individual-level metrics of rs-fMRI for the networks of interest will be obtained using independent component analysis and dual regression[26]. Computational modeling will utilize exploitation modules from reinforcement learning and the novel exploration module in the Value plus Sequential Exploration architecture[27]. Parameter recovery of competing models will be evaluated using traditional model fit comparators and Bayesian Group Comparison. Lastly, exploitation, loss aversion, decay, exploration, and choice consistency parameters will be extracted from the best-fitting model. Statistical Approach. Diagnosis, historical ideation/attempt, number of attempts, attempt lethality, attempt impulsivity, SUPPS-P Negative Urgency, SUPPS-P Perseverance, SUPPS-P Premeditation, PID5BF+ Disinhibition, PID5BF+ Negative Affectivity, rs-fMRI parameters, and extracted decision-making parameters will be subjected to fuzzy c- mean cluster analysis. This will be followed by discriminant function analyses, one for the emergent clusters and one for the ideators/attempters. Suicidality characteristics of the emergent clusters will be compared using factorial analysis of variance. Statistical power and sample size should be adequate for two expected clusters with a moderate degree of separation[28]. Further to this, we will use the same behavioural, computational, and neuroimaging variables in a generative embedding approach to machine learning[29] to develop an individual-person-level algorithm that could identify neurophysiologically distinct subgroups of individuals with historical suicidal ideation. Hypotheses 1) Self-report measures of affectivity and impulsivity will not differ among groups. Decision-making parameters, ECN, SN, and DMN network coherence will differ between controls and ideators but not between ideators and attempters. 2) Individuals with BPD and multiple low-lethality high- impulsivity attempts will have lower choice consistency, more loss aversion, less decay, and more exploration. 3) Two suicidal clusters will be significantly discriminated by a combination of PID-5-BF Disinhibition, SUPPS-P Negative Urgency, ECN coherence, SN coherence, and decision-making parameters in both the cluster analysis and machine learning analyses. Ideators and attempers will not be significantly discriminated; the machine learning algorithm will corroborate this lack of distinction. Academic Impact Individuals who tend toward multiple low-lethality impulsive attempts likely overrepresent so-called suicide attempters because morbidity rates may be higher for those who attempt suicide with a single well-planned high-lethality attempt. Paradoxically, the effort to prevent suicide by exclusively comparing ideators to attempters precludes us from better understanding individuals who die by suicide on their first attempt. Further to this, the study of impulsivity and decision-making in suicidology is unduly focused on average group differences and is mired in inconsistent results when the impact of acute affect is not considered. Accordingly, I propose the use of an innovative agentic social rejection task that will test a data-driven individual-person-level algorithm for suicide risk with the support of well established rs-fMRI biomarkers of suicide.","Each year, 800,000 people die by suicide, but for every death, there are 20 suicide attempts. Most folks who attempt suicide feel rejected and experience unbearable psychological pain, but the lethality, frequency, and impulsivity of their suicide attempts differ. Indeed, emotional sensitivity, decision making, and brain functioning may explain how people thinking about suicide are unique. In this proposal, resting brain activity will be combined with a novel task that simulates decision making in rejecting social situations. By combining these tools, I hope to reveal diverging patterns among suicidal individuals that ultimately inform personalized risk assessment and clinical intervention.",,"Suicide, Ideation, Impulsivity",Suicide,y,"Emotional Sensitivity, Decision Making, Impulsivity",Biomarker,Assessment,Human,Basic,"Mind and Body, Personalized Treatment",University of Toronto,2022,13200,13200,,,,,,,"13,200.00","13,200.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=lnunNUgAAAAJ&hl=en,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacob-Koudys,https://clinicalneurosciences.ca/,University of Toronto,,,,jacob.koudys@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kamiar Ghoseiri,,Audrey Zucker-Levin,The Effects of Targeted Phantom Motor Execution on Phantom Limb Control in People with Unilateral Transtibial Amputation,"Introduction Transtibial amputation (TTA) is the most common level of major limb amputation for which a prosthesis is prescribed to restore walking ability[1]. Exercises are traditionally prescribed to improve balance, strength, coordination, and endurance in the intact limb and the residual limb (the portion of the limb that remains after limb amputation; sometimes referred to as “stump”) [2, 3]. Unfortunately, prosthesis use is not intuitive and is often rejected because the wearer does not embody the prosthesis as an adequate substitute for an anatomical limb. Many people with TTA report an awareness that their missing limb still exists, known as phantom limb awareness (PLA). Some people report the perception of sensation or pain and some report the ability to move the limb with intention and accuracy, known as phantom limb control (PLC) [4-6]. Forty years ago, Abramson theorized the ability to control a phantom limb could be functionally integrated into completing daily physical challenges presented to the person with limb amputation [7]. Abramson’s theory has been explored in people with upper extremity limb loss, with evidence that people who use a myoelectric prosthesis, where the prosthetic hand moves in response to muscle contraction in the residual limb, have a better function when they visualize the prosthetic hand movement as if it was their own. Commercially available prostheses for people with TTA do not include an option for myoelectric function. Instead, the prosthesis relies on the users’ ability to mechanically load the limb. At heel strike, body weight is accepted onto the prosthesis and then smoothly progressed through the foot to load the prosthetic toe just prior to initiating the swing phase which releases stored energy and assists with push-off. Muscle contraction in the residual limb is not required for walking with a prosthesis. As a result, the person with TTA loss does not have the need to move the phantom limb, thus PLC is not routinely practiced. Precedence to actively move the phantom limb, known as phantom motor execution, has been established in the treatment of phantom limb pain (PLP). PLP, described as electrical twinges, squeezing, cramping, and burning in the phantom limb is not well understood but it is theorized to result from neuroplasticity in the central nervous system including both the cerebral cortex and spinal cord imposed by loss of normal sensation from an anatomical limb [8]. Restoration of the central nervous system physiology is thought to occur with phantom motor execution facilitated by mirror therapy or virtual reality training as evidenced by a short-term (less than one month) reduction of PLP [9, 10] [8, 9, 11, 12]. A substantial knowledge gap is exposed by these findings as it is not clear if the prescription of phantom limb exercise could improve function in people with TTA. We hypothesize that targeted phantom motor execution could impact peripheral control over the phantom limb, as identified by PLC, in people with unilateral TTA. Methodology Ethics approval has been obtained for this study. Thirty- two people with unilateral TTA who are independent community ambulators with a prosthesis will be recruited for this randomized controlled trial. Recruitment will be via word of mouth and flyers placed specifically in community centers, physician and prosthetist offices. Participants will be selected using a convenient sampling method and will be allocated randomly to the control (N=16) or exercise group (N=16). Prospective participants will first be phone screened to determine eligibility. To respect COVID-19 restriction and minimize contact, all eligible participants will be sent a link including a brief study overview and consent document for the Medical and Demographic questionnaire, the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire [13], and The Survey of Phantom Limb Awareness and Control [14]. All data will be collected through the secure Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform. After completion of the online surveys, participants will be scheduled for in-person baseline and follow-up testing. The baseline testing visit will begin with a review of expectations and a review of informed consent. During the baseline testing visit, the researcher will collect/assess anthropometric data (i.e. height, weight), the morphology of the residual limb (i.e. length, circumference, and volume), and functional ability as measured by PLC. Because movement of the phantom limb can not be visualized, PLC will be assessed using electromyography (EMG) (Delsys, Trigno; Natick MA) and force under the plantar surface of the intact foot (Novel, Loadsol® St Paul MN) while the participant performs ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and heel rise/down movements bilaterally [15]. The EMG will allow the researcher to determine the participant's ability to control the movement of the phantom limb while the instrumented insole will provide data on the direction in which the phantom foot is moving based on plantar force distribution. After baseline testing, participants randomized to the exercise group will receive training on targeted phantom motor execution to be performed in addition to their usual and customary post-amputation care; participants allocated to the control group will continue with their usual and customary post-amputation care. The targeted phantom motor execution program is a three-week home-based exercise training program directed at the movement of the phantom ankle-foot complex of people with unilateral TTA. To respect COVID-19 restrictions, participants will perform the phantom motor execution program under the virtual supervision of the researcher using the Zoom application. It is performed in the sitting position, without the prosthesis, with eyes open, and with a progressive increase in the number of training days per week. Three, four, and five training days are programmed for the first, second, and third weeks of the program respectively. Participants allocated to the control group will be contacted once per week by the researcher to remind them of their upcoming follow-up testing session and to ask if they have any questions. All baseline measures will be repeated on all participants (both control and exercise group) by the same researcher at the follow-up testing visit. Data will then be analyzed within and between each group (control/exercise) as well as pre-and-post intervention. Further, data will be correlated with anthropometric, morphologic, and functional data.","Many people with limb amputation feel their amputated limb still exists, called a phantom limb. Some people report the ability to move their phantom limb, while others are not able to move their phantom limb. After the loss of a limb, the brain responds by changing how it functions, which may contribute to pain or loss of mobility. Increasing awareness of the amputated limb could restore the brain to its before amputation state. We will determine if a specific exercise program, designed to increase awareness and movement of the phantom limb, improves control of the phantom limb and physical function.","Exercise, Phantom Limb Pain","Limb, Phantom, Control, Prosthesis, Transtibial Amputation (TTA) , Motor, Exercise",Phantom Limb,n,Pain,Exercise,"Pain Reduction, Mobility",Human,,Mind and Body,University of Saskatchewan,2022,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=qwUJlScAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamiar-ghoseiri-202420281/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kamiar-Ghoseiri-2251919614,,University of Saskatchewan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jamie Morrison,,Brian Christie,Train Your Brain (TYB),"The Train Your Brain (TYB) project uses NeuroTracker 3D Multiple-Object Tracking software, a program widely used by professional athletes, military, and health professionals to improve cognitive functions. There are minimal non-pharmacological treatment options for TBI survivors and no “one treatment fits all” approach. NeuroTracker is a unique cognitive training tool; all brain lobes are engaged simultaneously while undergoing training, leading to strengthened connections between brain areas. This is evidenced by improvements in attention, memory, and executive functions after just 10 twenty-minute training sessions. TYB measures long-term cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injury and has shown potential to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. NeuroTracker is a three-dimensional, multi-object tracking tool that trains attention, awareness, and memory in a videogame format. NeuroTracker is an ideal training program for TBI survivors because it adapts to each user’s cognitive potential for the task and progressively challenges them. Participants are encouraged to engage in NeuroTracker training twice weekly for five weeks, as this has been shown to optimize performance and potential benefits. However, VBIS will accommodate participants who prefer to do only one weekly session. Ultimately, we want this program to be as accessible to our clients as possible. Each NeuroTracker software session takes 30 minutes to complete, including breaks. However, our team will schedule appointments for 45 minutes to allow for the participants to chart their TBI related symptoms (using the SCAT5 Symptom Screening Tool) Additionally, VBIS staff will administer the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory – Version Four (MPAI4) at the onset and the conclusion of the 5-week program. The MPAI4 is an assessment for individuals with an acquired brain injury and is designed to evaluate rehabilitation programs that provide services to people with brain injuries. The combined results from SCAT5 symptom screening and MPAI4 will be recorded by our team and used to gauge client progression throughout the program. In collaboration with VBIS, PhD Candidate Taylor Snowden completed two patient-oriented studies examining the benefits of 5 weeks of NeuroTracker cognitive training on adults with traumatic brain injuries. Participants who engaged in the NeuroTracker training experienced reductions in the number and severity of their TBI-related symptoms, with an average 50% reduction in symptom severity over 5-weeks of training (Snowden et al., in prep.). Further, participants demonstrated improvements in verbal memory, attention, processing speed and inhibition, as demonstrated on standardized neuropsychological assessments, compared to the waitlist-controlled group (Snowden et al., in preparation). Through exit interviews with participants, it is clear that NeuroTracker as one participant noted, “I felt very energized by the program, I felt like my brain was working hard and getting better”, while another highlighted, “the main thing it [NeuroTracker] helped was my attention and my focus in conversation, and my perception of my life has improved.” These early findings have helped show that the challenges faced by brain injury survivors related to memory, attention, and other executive functions can be improved through this program. VBIS will continue working with the University of Victoria to further understand all its potential benefits.

Kate Noseworthy,,Isabelle Aubert,Focused ultrasound-mediated stimulation of oligodendrogenesis and remyelination,"Background: Demyelination can impair axonal signal transmission between neurons resulting in weakness, paresthesia, and cognitive decline (1). Demyelination occurs in diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, (MS), stroke and traumatic brain injury. Such disorders can present with myelin damage, dysfunction or insufficiency of cells that create myelin, namely oligodendrocytes (OLs) or their progenitors, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Remyelination, the process by which myelin is spontaneously produced by OLs and deposited around demyelinated axons, is associated with prevention of axonal degeneration and the restoration of cognitive function (2,3). Indeed, in response to demyelinating pathologies or neurotraumas, OPCs proliferate, migrate, and rapidly infiltrate the lesion site at a density much higher than normal tissue (4,5). However, with increased disease progression and increasing age, OPCs fail to differentiate into mature myelinating OLs, thereby inhibiting complete remyelination and disease remission (6,7,8). In the adult brain, OPCs represent 2-8% of the total central nervous system (CNS) cell population and maintain a homogenous spread in all brain regions9. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular layer in the hippocampus can generate new OPCs, capable of differentiating into myelinating OLs in the corpus callosum (CC), striatum and fimbria fornix. Enhancing the generation, differentiation and remyelination ability of endogenous OPCs may be achieved by a combination of growth factors previously identified to be important during OPC development, proliferation, migration, and differentiation as well as environmental modifications to promote complete remyelination (10-13). Preliminary data from the laboratory of Dr. Isabelle Aubert has demonstrated that focused ultrasound combined with intravenously- injected microbubbles (FUS) can increase proliferation of OPCs and ultimately, oligodendrogenesis, by 5-fold in the hippocampus and 4-fold in the striatum, the latter a white matter void of NSCs. In the striatum, it is possible that 1) the increase in newborn OPCs observed in FUS- treated regions is a direct result of FUS-mediated activation of parenchymal OPC progenitors and/or 2) FUS-BBB modulation activates the injury-response of the progenitor cells in the in the SVZ, giving rise to OPCs that are recruited to FUS-targeted brain regions. The underlying mechanisms as well as the effects of FUS on progenitors when targeted directly to the SVZ, remain unknown. Hypothesis: FUS-mediated BBB modulation can non- invasively stimulate OPCs in white matter regions as well as generation of new OPCs in the SVZ leading to increased oligodendrogenesis and myelin formation. Methodology: FUS transiently (i.e. 4-6 hours) and temporarily modulates the permeability of the BBB at precise brain regions (14,15). Briefly, low intensity ultrasound waves cause intravenously injected microbubbles to oscillate in volume. The oscillating microbubbles interact with the vasculature wall, ultimately leading to the disruption of tight junctional complexes (15) and induction of active transport processes across the BBB (16). The safety of FUS-BBB modulation has been well established preclinically, and in patients with Alzheimer disease (17-21). To validate the generation, differentiation and migration of OPCs from NSCs in the SVZ, I will utilize the fact that Sox2 is expressed by NSCs in the SVZ (22) and employ Sox2CreERT:tdTomato reporter mice (23). Sox2CreERT:tdTomato mice enable permanent induction of tdTomato expression in Sox2-expressing NSCs through Cre recombinase induction following 7 days of tamoxifen treatment. Specific Aims: 1. Determine origin and maturity potential of newborn OPCs in the striatum following FUS-BBB modulation – FUS will be targeted unilaterally to the striatum in adult Sox2CreERT:tdTomato mice 3 days after completion of tdTomato-labeling of NSCs. 7 days post-FUS, the proliferative response of parenchymal OPC progenitors to FUS-BBB modulation will be determined by the colocalization of cell markers of proliferation and cell- specific markers of OPCs, such as nerve-glial antigen 2, restricted to regions of increased BBB permeability. The origin of newborn OPCs will be evaluated based on their colocalization with tdTomato, which would suggest an origin from NSCs in the SVZ. The maturation of newborn OPCs into mature OLs will be evaluated in FUS-targeted brain regions at 30 days post-FUS using immunohistochemistry to evaluate markers of mature OLs such as tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP). 2. Identify the impact of FUS-BBB modulation on SVZ progenitors proliferation, migration and maturation – 3 days following completion of tdTomato labelling, FUS will be applied unilaterally to the SVZ of adult Sox2CreERT:tdTomato mice, with the contralateral side serving as an internal control for subsequent analysis. I will track tdTomato-labelled cells from the SVZ along their ectopic migratory pathways for OPCs (i.e. white matter tracts of CC, striatum, and fimbria fornix) to determine changes in the migration of OPCs originating from NSCs following FUS-BBB modulation. 30 days post-FUS, I will evaluate the survival and maturation of migrated OPCs at their target destination by measuring the colocalization of tdTomato with cell-type specific markers of mature, myelin-forming OLs (TPPP-positive). 3. Identify the impact of FUS-BBB modulation on growth factor expression identified to be important during OPC development, proliferation, migration, and differentiation – RNA will be isolated from dissected FUS-treated regions (SVZ and striatum) at 4D and 30D post FUS, corresponding with the timing of OPC proliferation and differentiation into mature OLs post-FUS. qPCR will be used to evaluate the expression of growth factors and chemokines known to influence the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. Significance: Enhancing spontaneous remyelination holds great therapeutic potential to promote functional recovery in diseases of demyelination such as AD, but to date, there are no approved therapies that restore lost or damaged myelin. Strategies to promote remyelination include stem cell transplantation and reprogramming of differentiated cells into OPCs (24,25), however non- invasive routes of administration for these interventions are greatly limited in their efficacy (26). Here, we propose a non-invasive strategy to expand the endogenous OPC population and promote oligodendrogenesis and myelin formation which open a novel path of treatments for restoring cognitive function following demyelinating diseases, neurotrauma, or neurodegenerative diseases.","Surrounding nerve fibres in the brain exists an insulating sheath, termed myelin. Brain diseases and some brain injuries attack this protective coating or cause damage to cells that produce it. This results in impaired communication between the brain and the rest of the body and can lead to permanent damage or deterioration of nerves. We have demonstrated that ultrasound waves targeted to the brain through the intact skull has the potential to increase the number of myelin- producing cells. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms behind this regenerative process, hereby enabling us to fully utilise its potential for treatment of diseases.

Mohammad Parsa Oveisi,,John Griffiths,,"Rationale Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder and a global health concern (1-3). Because almost half of the cases are resistant to conventional interventions such as psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (4,5), alternative methods therapies are needed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been an effective and established alternative for treatment resistant MDD (6,7). Even so, the effectiveness of rTMS is ~50% with considerable room for improvement (8). An important recent development in this direction is the discovery (9-12) that inter-regional correlation patterns (functional connectivity; FC), measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can be used to achieve improved clinical outcomes through patient-specific rTMS target location optimization. The potential for this approach to yield widespread impact for patients is severely limited, however, by the prohibitive cost, complexity, and accessibility of fMRI-capable facilities. Fortunately, a highly promising alternative to fMRI has enjoyed considerable technological improvements in recent years, with major potential in a range of applications, including personalized rTMS neurostimulation therapy design. Functional diffuse optical tomography (fDOT) is a neuroimaging technique based on high-density functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements. Like fMRI, fDOT allows 3D volumetric reconstructions of haemodynamic brain activity time series (13); but unlike fMRI it achieves this from relatively simple and inexpensive scalp-based optical measurements. Last year, fNIRS manufacturers Kernel announced step-change improvement in fNIRS signal quality, channel density, and portability in their new Kernel Flow (KF) system, which they provided to a selected set of international collaborators. The Griffiths Lab at CAMH and University of Toronto is one of the ~5 research groups in the world currently working with one of these advanced-access KF fNIRS systems. In this project we will explore, for the first time, the use of high-density fNIRS fDOT FC as an alternative to fMRI FC for personalized prediction of rTMS stimulation effects. Methods The proposed project shall be an extension of an ongoing study at CAMH, in which N=30 healthy adult participants undergo 5 sessions of rTMS over a 10 week period. Shortly prior to rTMS application, 10 minutes’ resting state brain activity (concurrent fNIRS-EEG) are recorded using the KF device. rTMS effects (amount of long-term synaptic potential, LTP) are defined by the pre. vs. post change in amplitude of TMS-evoked potential measurements in the brain and wrist. In our analyses, we will examine the relationship between pre-stimulation fNIRS FC and LTP induction. 3D fDOT images will be computed from channel-level fNIRS data using the matlab-based Homer library (14) and in-house Python-based analysis tools (15). We will then follow established fMRI methodologies for parcellation-based identification of brain networks (16), and calculation of FC between the stimulation site and other regions. Pre vs. post rTMS comparisons will be made using mass-univariate bootstrapped general linear model and post-hoc two-sample t-tests. Regression- based models will be used to assess parametric effects of stimulation parameters and fMRI FC on putative LTP. The conventional power calculation approach (specify parametric hypothesis test, significance level of interest, minimum acceptable effect size, and desired statistical power) is unfortunately difficult to apply robustly here, since there is not yet any experimental literature on which to base estimates of a population effect sizes for fDOT response effects. Impact We anticipate that this work will be highly impactful in academic circles for two reasons. First, as noted, this will be one of the first major research studies conducted using a new KF system, which has received considerable attention in neuroimaging circles since its pre-release to partnering labs in late 2021 due to its superior technical specifications and form factor. Second, the prospect of substituting high-density fDOT FC for fMRI FC in personalized rTMS targeting - if we are able to demonstrate its feasibility - will be of major interest to the TMS brain stimulation and neuropsychiatry communities, as it would open the door for a wide range of novel and easily-run fDOT biomarker discovery investigations. Outside of academia, we naturally hope that this work will lead, eventually, to improvements in the planning, administration, and outcome of rTMS therapies for MDD and other conditions. In particular, the scope for deploying this technology in remote and/or non-affluent geographic areas (where fMRI would be impossible, for example), is a key potential future contribution. As noted above, we also expect that this work will generate interest from people in the non-academic science-literate general public and technology sectors, who my be following Kernel and other neurotechnology sector startups (e.g. Neuralink, Paradromics, PlatoScience).","Depression can, unfortunately, show resistance to psychotherapy and medication for many patients. Alternate therapies such as non-invasive magnetic stimulation show promise. However, due to individual differences, personalizing treatments can significantly improve efficacy. fMRI neuroimaging can identify many of these differences, but access to fMRIs is remains challenging. New optical imaging technologies like fNIRS fDOT provide alternatives to fMRI that are cheaper and portable. Using advanced novel analyses, we examine effectiveness of substituting conventional fMRIs with these newer technologies. We hope that in the future this work shall lead directly to personalized and effective treatments for brain disorders.",Personalizing rTMS,"rTMS, fMRI, fNIRS, fDOT, Stimulation",Major Depressive Disorder,n,Functional Connectivity,fNIRS fDOT,"Accessibility, Alternative Treatment",Human,,,University of Toronto,2022,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsa-oveisi-163b80223/,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mohammad-P-Oveisi-2275843649,https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/temerty-centre-for-therapeutic-brain-intervention,,CAMH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bin Hu",Building the Foundation for A Six-Pillar Brain Injury Management Program: Scoping Review Series,"Traumatic brain injury is a type of serious acquired injury that presents considerable challenges to the well-being and quality of life of those who sustain them. While there exist varied treatments, the outlook can often be arduous, slow, or limited and there is a distinct need for improved management approaches. This project is inspired by the experience of Dr. Matthew Galati, who experienced a traumatic brain injury as an adult in 2013 resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Dr. Galati embarked on an intensive rehabilitation program that involved multiple different modalities of treatment. With the help of this management approach, Dr. Galati was able to reintegrate into his previous lifestyle and continue a meaningful and active life. To contribute to improving the recovery experiences of adults who have experienced traumatic brain injuries, we aim to build upon the anecdotal experience of Dr. Galati, research he participated in, as well as the varied body of literature on management of this injury in adults. Following from previous research, emerging management techniques, clinical best practices, and Dr. Galati’s experiences, we will develop a multi-component recovery program for these injured adults. After several rounds of brainstorming and feedback from stakeholders in the field, including researchers, advocates, and a brain injury association, we developed the approach to building the foundation for a six-pillar brain injury management program. In short, the six-pillar program should be established based on evidence and each component and its associated steps for management should be informed by existing literature, where possible. As such, we are conducting six scoping reviews to explore the existing knowledge base on the topics of traumatic brain injury in adults, management or recovery, and each of the following: sleep, exercise, nutrition, harmful exposures, cognition, and mindfulness. The rationale for completing this type of review of the literature is that we need to compile current knowledge and identify the key findings as well as remaining gaps in order to inform the development of future clinical research, and scoping reviews are the most appropriate version. Undergraduate students from the University of Toronto and McMaster University were recruited to complete the scoping reviews under the supervision of the research coordinator. The knowledge translation deliverable will be an infographic or series of infographics incorporating the core messages from each scoping review. This infographic material will be developed for a general adult audience. The knowledge collated and synthesized in these scoping reviews and the infographic material will serve as the foundation for the six-pillar clinical traumatic brain injury management program for a pilot study in adults in the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton in Ontario. The long-term goal is to use the pilot studies as the basis for a larger clinical study that would result in new standard programming to be implemented broadly for this target population.

Sophia Loewen,,Marie-Ève Tremblay,Microglial Responses to Acute Vaporized Cannabinoids,"Microglia, the brain's resident immune cell, are implicated in the cognitive deficits associated with neurological conditions [1-4]. A class of molecules to which microglia react are cannabinoids [5,6], or compounds associated with Cannabis sativa. However, despite the increase in interest and recent legalization of recreational cannabinoid use in Canada, there is very little information on how vaporized cannabinoids modify microglial functions. Importantly, this is the most common form of consumption in humans, meaning this is a highly relevant, understudied area [7,8]. Understanding the effects of cannabinoids on microglia is important because these immune cells perform a wide variety of tasks that are necessary for the proper formation and function of the brain, including secreting trophic factors and cytokines that play key physiological roles, notably in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity [1-4,6]. Cannabis contains numerous cannabinoid compounds, with A 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most abundant [5]. Cannabinoids exert their effects by acting on the Gi/o-protein coupled receptors CB1 and CB2, which are both present on microglia [5,9, 10]. Many recent studies have shown that THC and/or CBD injected intravenously or intraperitoneally are able to modulate neuroinflammation induced by microglia, as cannabinoid receptors can down-regulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the production of anti inflammatory cytokines [5,6,9,11, 12]. However, the effects of translationally-relevant cannabinoid exposure on the physiological functions of microglia that could promote neuroprotection and synaptic integrity remain undetermined. Methods Project Aim: Elucidate Effects of Acute Cannabis Exposure on Microglia We will use young adult, male and female, C57BL/6J mice. Our collaborators at the University of Guelph, using established paradigms [13-15], will expose the mice to vehicle vapor (propylene glycol) or cannabis flower extracts (100mg/mL) from the Ontario Cannabis Store; specifically, we will use three strains: (high THC/negligible CBD [True OG]; negligible THC/high CBD [Pure Sun CBD]; balanced THC/CBD [Balance]. Mice will be acutely exposed over 15 minutes (one 10 second puff every 2 minutes) and euthanized, 30 minutes post-onset, when THC levels peak in the brain [16]. I will focus on the medial prefrontal cortex considering its key role in cognition, but other limbic brain regions will be analyzed as part of a larger study [17). Sub-Aim 1: Immunostaining and Imaging of Microglia Density, Distribution and Morphology Using skills I previously acquired, I will perform immunohistochemistry for IBA1 (marke of macrophages, including microglia) and TMEM119 (microglia specific but poorer at staining processes) to investigate microglia versus macrophage density and distributior (epifluorescent microscopy), as well as morphology and co-localization with functional markers such as CD68 for phagolysosomal activity (confocal microscopy) [18]. Sub-Aim 2: Ultrastructural Analysis of Microglia-Synapse Interactions To increase my technical skills, and given that Dr. Tremblay is the world's expert on the study of microglia using electron microscopy, I will examine the effects of vaporized cannabis using our new focused ion-beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). This will allow me to examine, at the ultrastructure level, microglial phagocytosis, and relationships with synapses. Sub-Aim 3: Change in Microglial Molecular Patterns With the BC Cancer Center, we will perform single cell RNA-sequencing using the 10x Genomics platform. This will allow us to examine how exposure to cannabis alters known microglia subpopulations (e.g., disease associated microglia, dark microglia) [19-22], as well as examine expression patterns of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. To obtain an effect size of 0.2, for confocal and electron microscopy, we will use 5-6 animals/group, 20-25 microglia/animal; the same animals will be utilized for all imagin To obtain an effect size of 0.6, for RNA sequencing, we will use 12 animals/group. Dat will be analyzed by a 2-way ANOVA (sex and extract) using GraphPad Prism with p<0.05 indicating statistical significance. Hypothesis We hypothesize that acute cannabis exposure (rather than chronically when receptors might be impaired) would lead to downregulated pro-inflammatory markers (RNA-sequencing) and decreased phagocytic markers (CD68). We hypothesize that RNA-sequencing data will show a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we hypothesize that cannabis extracts will increase microglial density (promoting beneficial interventions), result in a regular distribution (without unattended areas, surveillant morphology, and increased contacts with synapses. Potential Impact: Understanding the effect of cannabinoids on microglia is imperative with its recent legalization in Canada. This information could be used to pave the way for new therapeutics, research and contribute to policy and public health messaging. We will investigate male and female mice, contributing to an understanding of sex differences in these effects. This is the starting point, allowing us in the future to compare to effects of THC and CBD alone and the outcomes of longer-term exposure, notably upon injury or infection.","This project aims to understand the effect of vaporized cannabis on microglia, the immune cells of the brain. Microglia help regulate the healthy state of our brains, but they can also cause neurological conditions when they are not acting in a proper manner. Our project will focus on determining the effect of cannabis on microglia in the brain. By comparing the changes that vaporized cannabis causes to microglia in non-diseased states, we can determine the effect cannabis has on the healthy brain. These results will allow us to start to investigate how cannabis exposure may affect microglia in unhealthy brains.

Veronica Vuong,,Michael Thaut,The effect of memory load on cortical tracking of acoustic envelopes in continuous music listening ,"Background: Autobiographical memories are emotionally rich and play a crucial role in constructing and maintaining one’s sense of self throughout the lifespan (1). Importantly, perceptual and sensory stimuli can trigger autobiographical memories (2). Music, is in itself, inherently emotional; and often associated with meaningful events (i.e., the song you danced to at your wedding). Research demonstrates that listening to autobiographical salient music (ASM) can enhance memory retrieval from the past in healthy adults, and remarkably, in dementia (3). Our previous neuroimaging studies (4, 5) showed shared neural networks in autobiographical memory and ASM. When participants were exposed to unknown music 60 minutes prior to an fMRI scan, the neural network was mostly restricted to auditory processing regions. Conversely, ASM showed an extensive and widely distributed network of prefrontal, emotional, motor, and subcortical regions, sharing and extending beyond autobiographical memory areas. Music also possesses temporal regularity on multiple spectral parameters (i.e., meter, tempo, rhythm). Thus, it can act as a driver of entrainment, by influencing the state of a second system, resulting in synchronization. Recently, research has shown that endogenous cortical oscillations can entrain to dynamic fluctuations of continuous auditory input which can be directly observed via MEG recordings, termed envelope- tracking. Neural tracking of the acoustic envelope can be modulated by cognitive factors, including attention (6) and experience (7). One EEG study (8) investigated the effect of familiarity of music on cortical entrainment. Although the researchers found a stronger cortical response to unfamiliar music relative to familiar music, the results should be interpreted with caution due to methodological concerns, including a small sample group (n=8). It is also unknown whether the participants simply recognized the music, or whether they had associated autobiographical memories, which could affect neural representation and processing. The proposed study will test three conditions of music which differ by memory load: ASM; familiar music without autobiographical salience (FAM-NS); and unfamiliar music (UFAM), to investigate its relationship to the cortical response using MEG. Methods: A within-subjects design, single session. Healthy older adults (n=30) will be recruited from Baycrest Health Sciences. Inclusion criteria: - English speaking - Age 60+ - Montreal Cognitive of Assessment (MoCA) score ≥ 26 - Adequate vision and hearing - Able to undergo an MEG scan (i.e., no history of claustrophobia or ferromagnetic implant) Exclusion Criteria: - History of major mental illness - History of substance abuse - Dementia diagnosis - Psychoactive medication use Pre-experiment: During a phone interview, we will gather genre preferences and specific ASM with voice (n=16). We specify vocal songs to reduce confounds, as the neural representations for vocal and instrumental music may differ (9). Since we have an existing library of music (n=225) from our previous studies (4, 5), and will amass additional songs via the ASM condition, we will use these to compile the FAM-NS and UFAM conditions, matched by genre. 10-second music clips will be created. Before Scanning: To ensure the criteria of the ASM, FAM-NS and UFAM conditions are upheld, participants will be played the clips before scanning and rate their familiarity with the excerpt using a Visual Analog Scale. Clips that violate the criteria of a particular condition will be replaced with another excerpt and tested again. A demographics questionnaire (including musician status and music listening habits); and the MoCA will be administered to ensure participants are free of cognitive impairment. Experimental Task Design: After a brief MEG training session, participants will be played 10-second clips of 12 ASM, 12 FAM-NS, and 12 UFAM in an alternating fashion, with 5 seconds of white noise in between. The order of conditions will be counterbalanced. During the scan, participants will be instructed to passively listen and refrain from moving. Outcome Measures & Hypotheses: The primary outcome measure is the amplitude of the cortical oscillatory activity. It is hypothesized that the recorded neural activity will be synchronized to the music and better phase-locked to the acoustic envelope in the ASM condition relative to the FAM-NS and UFAM conditions. It is also hypothesized that between the conditions, a gradient of elicited brain regions will be observed, such that the UFAM condition will primarily elicit auditory areas; the FAM-NS condition will elicit auditory and memory areas; and the ASM condition will have the largest effect, eliciting regions responsible for audition, memory, and emotion. MEG Data Acquisition and Analysis: Neuromagnetic data will be acquired with a 275-channel whole head axial gradiometer MEG system in a magnetically shielded room. Data will be recorded continuously at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz, filtered online with a low-pass filter of 200 Hz, and a notch filter at 60 Hz. Data will be high-pass filtered post-acquisition at 0.1 Hz with a sixth-order Butterworth filter. Recorded responses will be noise-reduced via the CALM algorithm (10) and a time-shifter principal component analysis (11). Data analysis will be performed in MATLAB via the FieldTrip toolbox. The channel data will be visually inspected for artifacts and adjusted via a weighted average of the neighboring channel. Artifacts such as eye blinks and eye movements will be corrected by an independent component analysis in MATLAB. Time-frequency information (0.3 Hz to 50 Hz) will be extracted via a Morlet wavelet analysis. Cortical entrainment will be calculated by comparing the phase of time-frequency representations within conditions, following an equation implemented by Luo & Poeppel (2007) (12). The potential impact of the proposed study is substantial. This study will establish the foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASM in healthy adults. The next step will extend to an early dementia population. Understanding how listening to ASM can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease will establish the empirical foundation for the development of innovative, inexpensive, and enjoyable therapeutic interventions that will leverage accessible and intact musical neural networks to provide cognitive boosts. With the rising prevalence of dementia in Canada, costs are projected to amount to $16.6 billion dollars by 2031 (13). Thus, there is an urgent need for low-cost alternative therapies, such as music. However, an important preliminary step is to investigate healthy adults.","Increasing evidence shows that listening to music from self-defining periods of life, such as childhood and adolescence, can help older adults recall meaningful memories from the past. Additionally, music is rhythmic and can influence brainwaves (which are also rhythmic), and this activity can be tracked using a brain scanner. The activity may differ depending on whether you have strong personal memories with music or not. Importantly, we study healthy adults first to establish a baseline. Next, we will study people with dementia and observe any differences, allowing us to better understand the mechanisms of music and role of music-based interventions.","Music, Aging, Memory","Music, Neural, Autobiographical, Memory, Cortical",Dementia,n,Memory,Music,Intervention,Human,,Personalized Treatment,University of Toronto,2022,,,,,,,,,0.00,0.00,Graduate,Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=9uD97wMAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-vuong-3565b3363/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronica-Vuong,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milin Patel,,Raphael Schneider,Extracellular vesicles as prognostic biomarkers in multiple sclerosis,"1. Background Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common causes of neurological disability among young adults in Canada (Amankwah et al., 2017). Although the etiology of MS remains elusive, decades of research support the notion that activated immune cells cross from the blood into the brain, where they cause inflammatory lesions (Martin, Sospedra, Rosito, & Engelhardt, 2016). Over time, many people with MS (pwMS) experience impaired mobility, mood, cognition, and a decrease in quality of life (Gil-González, Martín-Rodríguez, Conrad, & Pérez-San-Gregorio, 2020). Recent studies have shown that treatment with strong immunotherapies can lessen disability and improve long-term outcomes for people with MS (pwMS) (Kappos et al., 2016, 2020). However, strong immunotherapies come with a high risk of side effects. Finding prognostic markers, also called “prognostic biomarkers”, could help pwMS decide whether or not they want to start taking strong immunotherapies. We postulate that such prognostic biomarkers can be found in the blood of pwMS. Extracellular vesicles Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanometer-sized particles that are released by cells and contain ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and proteins (Mathieu et al., 2021; Théry et al., 2018). Recent evidence suggests that various cell types actively secrete EVs and that their cargo can be taken up by recipient cells (Valadi et al., 2007). Since EVs contribute to the transfer of biological material between cells under pathological conditions (Lakkaraju & Rodriguez-Boulan, 2008), RNAs and protein derived from EVs can mirror the altered state of the cell of origin and may provide information about the severity of a disease (Hoen et al., 2012; Mallia et al., 2020). For example, it has been shown that blood- derived EVs from pwMS can activate immune cells (Mrad, Saba, Nakib, & Khoury, 2021), suggesting that exosomes transmit signals that can propagate immune cell activation in MS. Techniques to detect and characterize EVs have matured over recent years, and there has been a marked increase in biomarker studies involving EVs and their content (Zhou et al., 2020). Previously, we have shown that EVs from people with dementia can serve as biomarkers (McKeever et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2018). Whether EVs can help estimate prognosis in MS remains an open question (Mycko & Baranzini, 2020). 2. Hypothesis We hypothesize that characterizing EVs in the blood plasma of pwMS will emerge as a new way of assessing an individual’s disease stage and risk of future disability. Research question 1: Are there significant differences in size and number of plasma-derived EVs when comparing healthy people, people with mild MS, and people with severe MS? Research question 2: Are there significant differences in plasma-derived EV surface markers (tetraspanins) when comparing healthy people, people with mild MS, and people with severe MS? 3. Methods Local Research Ethics Board approval has been obtained for this study. Funding is provided through an institutional start-up fund. We use stored plasma from equal numbers of untreated male and female study participants, including sex- and age- frequency-matched healthy study participants. We will use plasma from healthy people (n=7), people with mild MS (n=7), and people with severe MS (n=7). All plasma samples have already been collected, using the standard operating procedures in the Schneider lab. i. EV isolation from plasma using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC): SEC is routinely used to isolate EVs from human plasma samples, resulting in high EV quality and yield from relatively small input volumes (Muller, Hong, Stolz, Watkins, & Whiteside, 2014; Théry et al., 2018). Our preliminary data suggest a high degree of reproducibility (not shown). ii. Size and number of plasma-derived EVs: We use nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to compare the size and number of plasma-derived EVs. Our preliminary data suggest that there are more EVs pwMS compared to healthy people (not shown). iii. We use Western blot and flow cytometry to quantify tetraspanins in our EV pools: We have established a protocol for the detection of the tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81. Using a standardized plasma input volume (500 μl), we will measure the intensity of the western blot bands to quantify the signal of each tetraspanin (CD9, CD63, and CD81) in each EV pool. We have detected all three tetraspanins in the plasma of pwMS (not shown). Statistical analysis: We will count the EVs using NTA and compare the intensity of the tetraspanin bands on the Western blot (qualitatively and quantitatively). We will use Student’s t-test and ANOVA for comparison between groups.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease that is one of the leading causes of neurological impairment in young adults. The prognosis is unpredictable, which is a challenge in clinical practice. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanometer-sized particles released by cells that seem to play a role in MS. In this project, we will analyze EVs in the blood of people with MS to assess the risk of future disability. We will use assays such as size-exclusion chromatography and Western blotting. This work will help us understand if EVs can be used to estimate prognosis for people with MS.

Raphael Schneider,,Raphael Schneider,A New Approach To Individualize Exercise For People With Multiple Sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability among young adults in Canada (1). Although the cause of MS remains elusive, decades of research support the notion that auto-reactive immune cells cross from the blood into the brain, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy can decrease the frequency of attacks in people with MS (pwMS), improving mid- and long-term prognosis (2, 3). Despite treatment, MS commonly progresses to some degree over time, and additional approaches to prevent disability accumulation are needed. Recent research suggests physical exercise can provide further protection against MS disease progression (4). Physical exercise benefits pwMS in a variety of ways, including through improvements in mood, cognition, mobility, balance, and overall quality of life (QoL) (5–7). The MS Society of Canada provides information about these benefits of exercise (https://mssociety.ca/). Most exercise studies have focused on pwMS who already have accumulated significant disability (5–7); however, little work has been done in early MS, and more specifically on the benefits of exercise tailored to individual abilities and needs. We believe that to maximize any preventative effect that physical exercise may have, we need to provide pwMS with an opportunity to intervene early in their disease course using an individualized approach. The variability in how physical activity is self-reported (i.e. reports on frequency and level of exertion) is a common obstacle in exercise research done outside the clinic setting. Wearable technologies or “wearables” are electronic devices that can be easily donned and doffed. Wearables allow remote monitoring of the timing, duration and intensity of exercise. Most commercially available wearables are limited in scope and fail to produce accurate measurements. The Hexoskin® (8–11), is a novel Canadian wearable technology that can reliably measure how often, long, and vigorously a person exercises. Hypothesis: Establishing an MS exercise program, optimized to meet the needs, capacity, and preferences of each individual should improve intervention acceptability, accessibility, adaptability, adherence, potential effectiveness and implementability. Aim/Objective 1 : Establishing a new physical exercise program for pwMS. Clinicians often recommend 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least three times per week (https://mssociety.ca/). More specific advice, for example, the intensity of the exercise, is difficult to provide, as every pwMS has different needs. To establish an individualized physical exercise program, we will first need to understand people’s behaviours and abilities. Using mixed research methods, including questionnaires and qualitative semi structured interviews, we will assess the impact of the exercise intervention on patient wellbeing and explore intervention and device (Hexoskin®) acceptability and implementability. Aim/Objective 2 : Quantifying biological changes that occur in the blood when pwMS exercise. Previous studies have shown that proteins relevant to inflammation and brain health can change in response to physical activity (13– 15), providing an important mechanistic rationale for assessing the impact of exercise. To quantify the effects of our exercise intervention, we will collect participant blood samples pre and post intervention. Participants and setting: We will recruit pwMS from the BARLO MS Centre at St. Michael’s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto. This is one of the largest MS clinics in the world with over 8000 patients. Twenty pwMS who have received a diagnosis of MS within the last year will be included in this study (n=20). Only adult pwMS with no or minimal disability will be included. Twenty healthy participants with similar demographics will be recruited as controls (n=20). Females outnumber males with MS with a ratio that varies by the geographic region from 2:1 to 3:1 (7). We will enroll pwMS as they are identified in the clinic and expect a 2:1 female to male ratio. We include age- and sex-matched healthy control participants (healthy family members and healthy people working at Unityhealth). Written informed consent will be obtained by our research coordinator. The study will start with an intake assessment at the BARLO MS centre. Each participant will receive a Hexoskin® to use at the BARLO MS centre and to take home for the duration of the study. Our staff will help set up the connection between the Hexoskin® and our secure portal at St. Michael’s Hospital to enable remote monitoring of physical exercise throughout the study. We will collect baseline questionnaire measures, blood and measure of physical fitness of all study participants during this initial visit, invite them to exercise on a stationary bike for 30 min, and address any feasibility concerns. Over 4 weeks, participants will exercise on their own at home, in a gym or outside for 30 min three times per week (a total of twelve units of 30 min). Each 30 min will include two 5 min periods of high- intensity interval training (HIIT), as HIIT has shown to be safe and effective in increasing fitness in pwMS (12). After 4 weeks, participants will come back to the BARLO MS centre for a final assessment, including the same measures collected at baseline. Patient-Related Outcome Measures: We will ask all study participants to fill out the Short Form Questionnaire (SF-36) and the Perceived Stress Scale, which are patient-related outcome measures (PROM) that have been used extensively to quantify health-related QoL and emotional wellbeing changes in pwMS (13, 14). Additionally, we will conduct semi-structured interviews to explore expectations, perceived effects, barriers and facilitators to participation and sustained use. At the end of the 4-week study period, we will be able to provide feedback to study participants about how to continue or modify their physical exercise program and behaviours to maximize the benefits of physical exercise within their individual abilities. Questionnaires filled by the participants alongside semi-structured interview findings will inform us about the impact of exercising on their wellbeing and the overall end-user experience with Hexoskin®. Blood biomarkers: We will study 5 blood biomarkers using the ultra-sensitive Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa®), available in the Schneider lab at the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science. Blood will be taken at the intake and at the final in-person assessment. 1. Neurofilament light protein (NfL) and 2. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): Neurons and glial cells can sustain significant damage in MS. Their scaffolding proteins, neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), are emerging biomarkers of disease activity in MS and have been shown to decrease after physical exercise (15). ","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory condition where brain and spinal cord damage can lead to significant disability. Physical exercise can benefit people with MS; however, currently, recommendations are not tailored to an individual’s abilities and needs. We propose herein a personalized physical exercise strategy. During a 4-week exercise program, we will measure physiological fitness variables using Hexoskin® - a smart shirt lined with biosensors. Via contactless data transmission, the Hexoskin® provides easy access to numerous physiological measures related to overall health and fitness. This will allow us to modify our physical exercise program in response to each individua’s needs. We will also measure markers of inflammation and brain health in the blood of study participants, which will provide us with new information about the benefits of exercise on the molecular level.",,"Exercise, Physical, Intervention, Hexoskin, Disability",Multiple Sclerosis,n,Inflammation,"Exercise, Hexoskin (shirt tracking biomarkers)",Benefits of Exercise,Human,,,University of Toronto,2022,50000,50000,,,,,,,"50,000.00","50,000.00",Seed,Seed,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=vGi6zIgAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-schneider-md-phd-frcpc-b3687521/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael-Schneider-4,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nicola Janz,,Robert Laprairie,Mushrooms or psilocybin extract? Exploring the entreruage effect in psychedelics to treat depression,"Many psychedelic substances are gaining interest for their potential in treating otherwise treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions such as depression [1]. Psilocin, the active metabolite of the natural substance psilocybin, activates serotonin (5HT) receptors. Psilocybin is a natural substance found in fungi [2]. Psilocin produces psychotropic effects by activating the5HT2a receptor [3]. 5HT2a is a G-alpha-q/11 - coupled receptor, but it also interacts with beta-arrestins [4]. This is important because while G-alpha-q/11 proteins are believed to facilitate the psychotropic effects of psilocin such as antidepressant effects, beta-arrestins are believed to facilitate the hallucinogenic effects as well as tolerance [4). Thus, a mushroom extract which shows a bias to G-alpha-q/11 rather than beta-arrestin would most likely have an optimal psychotropic effect. In addition, an ideal mushroom extract would have a longer duration of action than pure psilocybin. It is likely that the other components of mushroom extract affect these factors. For example, they may slow the metabolism of psilocin, making the duration of action longer. Different types of mushroom extracts may have different psychotropic effects because of the extra compounds they contain.The purpose of this project is to investigate which compositions of mushroom extract maximize antidepressant effect. This is essential because psilocybin has potential to be beneficial to individuals suffering psychiatric conditions, but there is a lack of research on its complex effects. My hypothesis is that the mushroom extracts will have a greater antidepressant effect than the psilocybin alone, because the complex mixture of compounds in the mushroom extracts promotes a longer duration of psilocin's action. To test this hypothesis, a forced swim test will be performed on rats to measure the antidepressant effect of mushroom extracts; the amount of time spent swimming represents this effect. Method: Activating 5HT2a in rodents gives important information about the clinical outcomes of psilocin in humans. For this project, rats are put into a glass cylinder with water which they cannot get out of. The amount of time spent swimming and the amount of time spent immobile are measured 30 min, 1h, and 2 h after the administration of the product, for 5 min per swimming session. The rats will be recorded on video for subsequent data analysis. The product will be administered via oral gavage. The forced swim test measures behavioural despair because a reduction in time spent immobile is thought to represent an antidepressant effect [5]. One possible problem with the forced swim test is if the product increases overall locomotor activity, the rat's swimming behaviour would not accurately represent the antidepressant effects. However, in a recent study, it was reported that locomotor activity actually decreases slightly in rats at doses higher than 0.3 mg/kg psilocybin [6]. Overall, the forced swim test is a well-established assay for preclinical trials of antidepressants [5]. The forced swim tests will be performed with n=6 rats per sex and treatment, although sex differences are not anticipated. The five treatment groups include: vehicle control (saline), pure psilocybin (3.0 mg/kg psilocybin), and three mushroom extracts (containing 3.0 mg/kg psilocybin). The data will be analyzed blinded to treatment groups to eliminate bias. It will be expressed as the mean SEM from independent experiments as percent effect relative to the pure psilocybin. Assuming there will be a similar effect size (twofold increase) and error (SD=50%) as a previous study [7], the sample size of n=12 gives the power with beta=0.8 in an ANOVA with five treatment groups. This sample size of n=12 per treatment will likely detect statistical significance of p<0.05, using one-way ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons. This research will expand the scientific community's knowledge of how various psilocybin-containing products produce differing effects. This is important for understanding the medical importance, as well as the negative effects of psilocybin. Research on psilocybin will have huge effects on society. As research on psychedelic drugs increases, policy makers begin to consider their medical uses, or their decriminalization. The introduction of psilocybin in medicine could help people experiencing psychiatric conditions such as depression. In addition, understanding the effects of different psilocybin containing products will make harm reduction easier. My research will begin at the start of May. Dr. Laprairie's lab already has funding for the research, and approvals for controlled substances and animal ethics. The first 2-3 weeks will consist of on-site training in the forced swim test, animal ethics, and biosafety. Then, I will begin performing the forced swim tests. It will take approximately 10 weeks to perform the forced swim test on 60 rats at the 3 time points. This will continue until early August. The rest of August will be spent analyzing data, writing a report with my findings, and making research posters. The Laprairie lab currently consists of 10 members ranging from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows. Students work independently on their own projects, but participate in weekly lab meetings to present their findings and research articles they have read. Within the larger scope of the project, work on the forced swim test is a major component of a larger study involving psilocybin and psilocybin-containing products in collaboration with Psilotec Inc. The findings of the forced swim tests will extend our preliminary findings into a rodent model of depression in conjunction with parallel studies exploring rodent models of anxiety, sociability, and pharmacokinetics.","Psilocybin is a drug found in certain species of fungi. It affects mood, including depression, by activating serotonin receptors in the body. The purpose of this project is to research the effects of different psilocybin containing products. To do this, rodents will undergo the forced swim test, which measures their behavioural despair under the influence of the psilocybin-containing product. This can be used to model the clinical effects of these products on humans. This research is essential because in order to consider its medical uses, we need to first fill in the gaps of our knowledge of psilocybin.","Psychedelics, Depression ","Suicide, Ideation, Impulsivity",Major Depressive Disorder,y,Seritonin Receptors,Psilocybin ,Assessment,Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Saskatchewan,2022,7000,4200,,,,,,,"4,200.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Nicola-Janz-2244151780,,University of Sadkatchewan,,,,njanz2010@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,1,,
Alishba Afaq,,Shannon Dunn,Repeated Concussions as a Risk Factor for Central Nervous System Autoimmunity,"Rationale: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by demyelination and neuronal dysfunction (1). The disease is thought to be mediated by myelin-reactive T helper 1 (Th1) or Th17 cells that target the CNS myelin (2). MS patients experience a range of neurological symptoms including weakness, cognitive impairment, numbness, ataxia, and fatigue (3). Although the exact etiology of MS is unknown, several environmental and genetic risk factors have been implicated (4). One risk factor is the experience of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in adolescence (5). It is unclear how concussions predispose to MS; however, it has been speculated that the injury causes a release of myelin protein antigens that then activate myelin-reactive T cells in the periphery or the CNS (5). In support of this notion, CNS cryo-injury has been shown to exacerbate immune cell infiltration in the CNS in early experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Furthermore, giving a spinal cord contusion injury to Lewis rats was shown to activate myelin-specific T cells; these myelin-specific T cells also had the potential to transfer EAE (6,7). Although these findings prove that severe CNS trauma can sensitize myelin-reactive T cells, the effects of mTBI modeling concussion injury on CNS autoimmunity has not been explored. Purpose: Here, we will explore the effect of single and multiple mTBI injuries on CNS injury and the development of CNS autoimmunity in mice. We will use the weight drop model of closed head injury developed by Flierl et al (8). In this model, the extent of brain trauma is determined by the nature of the apparatus (resistance, force absorption), weight drop height, and the mice used (strain, sex, weight) (8). In a pilot study, we found that a 3 cm drop height resulted in a mild and transient elevation in the neurological severity scale (NSS) and elicited microglia activation in white matter tracts in the brain. The plan is to repeat the injury in a larger number of males to see how reproducible it is and then to calibrate the model in female mice at smaller drop heights because this sex is more susceptible to injury- associated mortality (8). These pilot studies will set the stage for experiments to explore the ability of the mTBI to induce autoimmunity. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that even a mild TBI will cause myelin damage. We ultimately hypothesize that mTBI will sensitize myelin-specific T cells and initiate CNS autoimmunity, particularly in female mice. Methods: Mice will be anesthetized with isoflurane and provided an analgesic. The weighted rod will be released from a specific drop height onto the mouse’s head to target the intersection of the parietal and cerebellar lobes. The severity of neurological impairment will be scored at 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-injury using the NSS. At the end-point, blood will be taken to measure the extent of injury (soluble neurofilament and myelin protein) and brains will be harvested for histological analysis of immune inflammation (CD45 staining), axonal injury (SMI-32 staining), myelin damage (QD9 staining), and blood- brain barrier leakage (fibrinogen staining) in the brain using specific antibodies and immunohistochemistry (9,10). After titrating the model in both sexes, in future work, we will next examine the effects of single versus repeated mTBIs on these outcomes and will examine whether the injury causes the expansion of myelin reactive T cells using an ELISPOT assay. These studies will be done in the presence and absence of an adjuvant to boost the immune response. We will also explore the effect of dietary changes (diet-induced obesity or vitamin D deficiency, high-fiber diet) to enhance or prevent autoimmunity in response to head injury. Impact: Concussions are an MS risk factor and are responsible for over 70% of traumatic brain injuries each year and are common amongst athletes playing high contact sports such as hockey, boxing, and football (11). Our study will provide mechanistic insight into how concussions may trigger MS and lead to the development of a pre-clinical model of mild myelin injury that can be used to investigate therapeutic agents preventing CNS autoimmunity. In addition to the dietary interventions mentioned, we can explore the effect of a novel myelin stabilizing agent on the prevention of CNS autoimmunity (12).","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) attributed to genetic and environmental risk factors. One MS risk factor is experiencing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), such as a concussion, during adolescence. It is unclear how concussions predispose individuals to MS but is speculated to involve the activation of self-reactive immune cells in the CNS. Our study aims to model concussion injury in mice to determine its effect on CNS pathology. We predict that an mTBI in mice will initiate CNS autoimmunity and provide insight into how concussions may trigger MS.","Concussion, MS Risk, Sex Differences","Injury, Myelin, Central Nervous System (CNS), Autoimmunity","""Multiple Sclerosis, TBI""",n,"Central Nervous System, Myelination",Analgesic,Autoimmunity,Animal,,,University of Toronto,2022,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alishba-afaq/,,,Univerisity of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Valerie Taylor,,Valerie Taylor,What's Bugging the gut in OCD? A clinical trial to evaluate the saftey and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in a population with Major Depressive Disorder,"There now exists compelling evidence of an interaction between the intestinal microbiota, the gut, and the central nervous system (CNS) in what is recognized as the gut-brain axis (GBA). It has been shown, for example, that the absence and/or modification of the gut microbiota in mice affects the hypothalamic–pituitary– adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress and the development of both anxiety and depressive-like behavior.1-4 Adding to this knowledge base, our own work highlights the difference between the microbial composition of individuals with and without major depressive disorder (MDD.5 We collected stool samples prior to antidepressant initiation and over 6 months of follow-up and using 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing analyzed gut microbial community profiles based on treatment responses. Participants that responded to antidepressants exhibited greater phylogenetic diversity than those in the treatment resistant depression group (rMDD). Overall, 42 Operational Taxonomic Units were significantly different between the groups. This link between clinical efficacy and microbiome change was further supported by our work looking the impact of the antidepressant Infliximab, where again, drug response was linked to gut microbiome change.6 Perhaps most compelling, however, is that for the first time there is evidence of a causal link between the gut microbiome and mental illness; stool from humans with mental illness, when transferred to germ-free mice via a fecal matter transplant, led to the development of illness- like behaviors in the recipients.7, 8 These findings highlight the important role of bacteria in the bidirectional communication of the GBA and suggest that manipulation of this system may offer new options for the treatment of mental illness, either directly via the GBA, or indirectly by impacting the way current antidepressants are metabolized. Our recent meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature has indicated that treatments that target the gut microbiome have potential to impact psychiatric outcomes9 and we believe that the necessary next step is to investigate the mechanisms behind this intriguing association, with an end goal of understanding the active components driving this response so that we can develop novel treatments for depression. Despite the existence of compelling preclinical work pertaining to the GBA, there has thus far been failed translation of this into potential clinical options.10 This may be due in part to the fact that current approaches at looking into microbial composition of those with depression, however, have found conflicting results, in part because (i) the microbial analysis approach was not sophisticated enough to accurately identify bacteria11 or (ii) the use of primary clinical data sources defined by self-report or quality of life indicators instead of a clinical diagnosis.12 Interestingly, this work has not expanded beyond mood disorders, despite the fact that almost two decades ago obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) was found to be associated with streptococcal infections, and the term, PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus), was developed to describe this phenomenon.13 There is data to support an OCD-GBA link, with studies showing that pre-treatment using the probiotic L. rhamnosus in mice reduced OCD behaviors.14 Further, in healthy humans, probiotic formulations including L. helveticus and B. longum administered daily for 30 days have been shown to reduce “obsessive-compulsive” subscores on symptoms checklist.15 In keeping with recommendations from the literature therefore, we feel it is important to begin to explore FMT, a GBA targeted treatment, to try to find alternative treatments for OCD. However, there are challenges to using FMT as a treatment due to the risk of infection,16 and is complicated with respect to conferring long-term vulnerabilities to other illnesses; if a healthy donor later develops a neurological disease for example, has risk for that condition been conveyed to the recipient?17 Therefore, understanding the active components of the FMT driving the improved treatment response is critical to developing bacterial based therapies. Currently however, the conventional way to assess how FMT changes the gut flora is via analysis of stool. This may not allow us to identify the necessary bacterial changes required to develop precision bacterial therapeutics. The distribution of microorganisms varies along the length of the gastrointestinal tract, and is governed primarily by pH, oxygen, antimicrobial peptide, and bile acid gradients.18 The bacterial density increases from 101 – 103 in the stomach and duodenum, to 104 – 106 in the jejunum and ileum, and finally 1011 – 1012 in the colon.19 Furthermore, the acidic pH and oxygen-rich environment of the proximal small intestine favours microbial colonization with acid- and oxygen-tolerant bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Veillonella), whereas in the colon, oxygen-poor conditions and slower transit results in fermentation of complex polysaccharides, resulting in greater taxonomic diversity and dominance of saccharolytic anaerobic Bacteroidales and Clostridiales.20 Perturbation of microbial composition and shift from the normal gut flora (dysbiosis) is thought to contribute to a variety of disease states, including irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia.21, 22 The small bowel is thought to be particularly vulnerable to dysbiosis due to the enormous population of bacteria in the colon. When there is dysfunction of protective mechanisms (e.g. antimicrobial gastric and biliary secretions, anterograde peristalsis preventing microbial adherence, ileocecal valve inhibiting retrograde translocation of colonic bacteria, mucin production by mucosal epithelial cells trapping bacteria, cellular/humoral immunity, and anti-bacterial peptides), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may occur.23, 24","Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition marked by recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and ritualistic behaviors aimed at reducing distress (compulsions). The estimated lifetime prevalence of OCD is 2–3% in the population. While there exist a number of medications to treat this illness, half of those whom need them either do not respond or can not tolerate current medications because of side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new ways to treat this illness. One of the areas being explored as a potential option is based on what is now known as a strong link between the bacteria that live in our gut and the brain. Our work has shown that a fecal transplant of the gut bacteria from healthy donors is able to improve health outcomes for people with depression and we now want to expand this into OCD, given a known link between this condition and bacterial infection. It is essential to know not just if this treatment works however, but to understand how it works, so this knowledge can be used to design a bacterial based medication for the treatment of OCD. To do this we will use both the standard methods of bacterial identification via stool analysis, which looks at large bowel changes, and compare it to the Small Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (SIMBA) system, a small capsule that when swallowed allows a sample to be collected from their small intestine. This work will help us assess the benefits of fecal transplant in OCD, and more importantly, identify how transplant changes the system, utilizing a novel technology to move the field forward.","OCD, Fecal Transplant, Gut-Brain Axis, MDD","Gut, Microbial, GBA, Bacterial, Microbiome","""Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety""",y,HPA Axis,Fecal Transplant,"Gut-Brain Axis, Treatment",Animal,,,University of Calgary ,2022,120000,120000,,,,,,,"120,000.00","120,000.00",SPG,SPG,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=4YCIGjAAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerie-h-taylor-md-phd-icd-d-4234a414/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Valerie-H-Taylor-38682076,https://www.vtaylorlab.ca/,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah Thompson ,,Avril Mansfield,The effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive and motor function among people attending rehabilitation post-stroke,"Cardiorespiratory fitness refers to the respiratory and circulatory systems' capacity to deliver oxygen to muscles during physical activities. A minimum level of cardiorespiratory fitness is required for even basic activities, like walking around the home and bathing. People with stroke often have such low cardiorespiratory fitness that they struggle to complete some daily activities (1-3). Aerobic exercise is planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity performed with a prescribed frequency, duration, and intensity aimed to improve or maintain cardiorespiratory fitness. Aerobic exercise post-stroke improves cardiorespiratory fitness (4-6) and general health, reducing risk of another stroke (7). Importantly, aerobic exercise is beneficial and safe early post-stroke (5)and clinical guidelines recommend completing aerobic exercise during stroke rehabilitation, as soon as possible once medically stable 8). Completing exercise during stroke rehabilitation may promote longer-term exercise participation after discharge,(9) which can improve the long-term health and lives of those with stroke. Despite the benefits of aerobic exercise for people with stroke, and its inclusion in Canadian stroke best-practice guidelines, (10) physiotherapists experience significant barriers implementing exercise for their clients during rehabilitation. Health system policies in many jurisdictions, including Ontario, focus care on improving Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores from admission to discharge. Preliminary data from our ongoing study suggests that this focus on improving FIM scores is a significant barrier to physiotherapists' implementing aerobic exercise during rehabilitation; physiotherapists instead focus therapies on functional activities that they believe are more likely to translate to improved FIM scores. Conversely, there is evidence that, in addition to improving cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic exercise can improve physical and cognitive function amongpeople with stroke (e.g., walking ability, Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores) (4,5,11,12). This is likely due to aerobic exercise promoting neuroplasticity, translating to improved neural repair and cortical reorganization, (13,14) and improved functional recovery. Few studies have specifically examined the effect of aerobic exercise on FIM scores. Knowing if aerobic exercise can improve FIM scores would facilitate implementing aerobic exercise in stroke rehabilitation when health system policies focus on changes in FIM scores. A meta-analysis found that aerobic exercise did not lead to greater improvements FIM scores than control interventions among people with stroke (15). However, most studies in this analysis included people with chronic stroke (i.e., >6 months post-stroke). People typically receive rehabilitation services in the earlier, sub-acute, stages of stroke recovery, which is when the greatest and fastest improvements in function are observed; FIM scores are not expected to improve in the later, chronic, stages of stroke recovery. A more recent study, focused only on people with post-stroke cognitive impairment found that FIM scores were higher after the intervention for people who completed aerobic exercise and cognitive training than a control group (12). We are unaware of any study examining the effect of aerobic exercise on FIM scores among the general population of people sub-acute stroke attending rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to determine if people with sub-acute stroke who complete aerobic exercise during stroke rehabilitation have greater improvements in FIM scores than people who do not complete aerobic exercise. This study will involve secondary analysis of data collected for a larger study. The dataset includes ~400 people admitted to in-patient stroke rehabilitation at two rehabilitation hospitals over the course of 14 months (2 months prior to and 12 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic). The dataset includes FIM scores, information on aerobic exercise participation during rehabilitation (e.g., number of sessions, training intensity), participant demographics, stroke characteristics (e.g., time post-stroke, lesion location), and clinical outcomes (e.g., motor and cognitive impairment). We estimate that approximately 15% of patients in the dataset (i.e., ~60 patients) will have completed aerobic exercise during rehabilitation. Patients who did not complete aerobic exercise will be randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis so that the two groups are similar on key variables (e.g., age, sex, baseline FIM scores). Due to changes in healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will ensure that there are the same number of participants pre- and post-pandemic in both groups. Analysis of covariance, controlling for admission scores, will be used to compare the following outcomes between groups at discharge: FIM total score, FIM motor and cognitive sub-scores, and FIM efficiency (change in FIM scores from admission to discharge divided by length of stay). Despite the benefits of aerobic exercise, health system policies, focused on specific outcomes (i.e., FIM scores), can be a significant barrier to physiotherapists implementing aerobic exercise in stroke rehabilitation. Demonstrating that FIM scores improve among people who complete aerobic exercise during stroke rehabilitation may facilitate implementing this important therapy in practice.","Aerobic exercise has widespread effects on the human body, such as improving function of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Aerobic exercise also releases chemicals that can help the brain to recover and repair after an injury, like a stroke, and could then lead to improved moving and thinking ability. Previous research has found that aerobic exercise is safe for people early after stroke, and can improve fitness. We expected that moving and thinking function would also improve with aerobic exercise during stroke rehabilitation. To test this hypothesis, we compared moving and thinking function at discharge from rehabilitation between people who completed aerobic exercise during stroke rehabilitation to those who did not, controlling for baseline differences between groups.","Exercise, Stroke, Rehabilitation ","Stroke, Exercise, Aerobic, FIM, Rehabilitation, Cardiorepiratory",Stroke,n,Respiratory and Cardiovascular systems,Aerobic Exercise,Rehabilitation,Human,,Mind and Body,University of Toronto,2023,7000,7000,,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sc-thompson/,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sarah-Thompson-2289322479,,University of Toronto,Michael Garron Hospital ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nooshin Esmaeli,,Brian Robert Sinclair,Moving Boundaries Human Science and the Future of Architecture Summer Course 2022,"Part of my PhD research focuses on the intersection of Neuroscience and Architecture. Currently, most of the research in this area is happening in the US and I am hoping to open a Canadian Chapter of the Academy of Neuroscience for Architects (ANFA) in Calgary to begin this journey at the University of Calgary. The goal is to gather Canadian architects, neuroscientists, and environmental psychologists to collaborate for a better design of our built environment and create spaces that result in the health and wellbeing of the users. For first step to start this chapter (as a committee chair) in Canada and also to get familiar with ANFA, meet the board in person as well as educate more in this field, I am taking this two-week course offered by the ANFA to train under the guidance of some of the world’s well-known architects, scholars, designers, and neuroscientists. Our buildings, neighborhoods, and cities directly impact our health and well-being. This basic fact is appreciated increasingly across the full range of professions involved in the design and maintenance of the built environment. At the same time, we know little of how the relationship between persons and environments works in detail: how exactly our experience and behavior, emotions, and engagement in the community are shaped by the built environment. A groundbreaking summer course and workshop, titled Moving Boundaries: Human Sciences and the Future of Architecture, held in Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, Spain) and Porto (Portugal), will bring together over twenty-five distinguished international speakers: scientists and architects, historians and philosophers, who will illuminate multiple facets of the impact of the built environment on human health and well-being. The course will feature numerous tours, field trips, and workshops, in which we will uncover the rich cultural heritage of both regions, illustrating sustainable and resilient relationships of the person, community, and place. The program will provide each participant with numerous opportunities of interaction with some of the best minds in architecture, urban design and science — during classes, roundtable discussions and workshops, but also during many social events planned over these two weeks. We will learn together, from one another and from the unique environment of this course, gaining the strength for transforming architectural education and practice the world over.",,,,,,,,,,,Mind and Body ,University of Calgary,2023,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8VI1ahwAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nooshinesmaeili/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nooshin-Esmaeili-2,,University of Calgary,https://obrieniph.ucalgary.ca/about,,,nooshin.esmaeili@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chinaza Dibia,,Isabelle Aubert,Gene immunotherapy approach regulated by intrinsic pathological stages present in a mouse model of Amyloidosis,"Rationale\r\nThe accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta peptides (A) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1. The efficacy of current anti-Aβ immunotherapies for patients with AD can be improved by increasing their penetrance to the brain combined with gene therapy to provide long-term beneficial effects in a single treatment. Gene therapy can modify brain cells to continuously produce anti-A antibodies in response to Aβ pathology. One major challenge of gene therapy for the treatment of AD is regulating gene expression in the brain and avoiding peripheral organs. My goal is to develop a non-invasive and regulatable gene therapy approach in a mouse model of AD, with high expression of therapeutic genes specifically where and when they are most needed in the brain. To achieve this, I propose the use of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter.\r\n\r\nStudies from the Aubert lab have shown that GFAP expression increases in astrocytes associated with Aβ plaques2, and following the modulation of the blood-brain barrier using transcranial focused ultrasound in the presence of microbubbles (FUS)3. Based on this knowledge, using a GFAP promoter may serve as a personalized and innovative strategy to self-regulate the expression of a therapeutic gene in response to Aβ pathology and by using FUS as required to further enhance treatment efficacy. Hence, I will utilize the GFAP promoter for the regulation of the expression of an anti-A antibody, termed rSol. rSol is a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody targeting Aβ, based on the full-length antibody Solanezumab. \r\n\r\nPreliminary studies\r\nTo support the premise of my experimental approach, I verified that the levels of GFAP mRNA, which are relevant to the activity of the GFAP promoter, increase with disease progression in the CRND8 transgenic (Tg) mouse model of amyloidosis. In 3, 5-and 6-months old Tg mice, I evaluated the expression of GFAP mRNA in the hippocampus, which is a brain region of relevance to AD. In these Tg mice, A pathology begins at 3 months of age (Fig. 1).  My results demonstrate that the levels of hippocampal GFAP mRNA increase with age in Tg mice, and compared to non-Tg littermates (nTg) (Fig. 2)4, supporting the potential of using the GFAP promoter to regulate the expression of a therapeutic gene in this mouse model.\r\n\r\nHypothesis\r\nAstrocytic activation by amyloid pathology and FUS can increase the expression of anti-A antibodies encoded under the control of a GFAP promoter in a Tg mouse model of AD.\r\nThe hypothesis will be tested using sex-balanced groups of Tg mice. Under the control of the GFAP promoter, rSol – or the non-biologically active anti-GFP-scFv control, will be encoded in the recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) PHP.eB; derived from rAAV9 and with enhanced capability of crossing the blood-brain barrier, reaching and transducing brain cells, including astrocytes, after intravenous injection5. \r\n\r\nSpecific aim 1 – GFAP promoter efficacy in response to Aβ pathology\r\nThe PHP.eB vector will be engineered to encode the non-therapeutic anti-GFP-scFv under the control of the GFAP promoter (PHP.eB.GFAP.anti-GFP-scFv). PHP.eB.GFAP.anti-GFP-scFv will be injected intravenously in Tg mice at 2  months of age, to evaluate the levels of expression of anti-GFP-scFv in response to A pathology. Such non-therapeutic control, instead of the therapeutic rSol scFv, is preferable to avoid interfering with Aβ pathology because the goal is to determine the self-regulation potential of gene expression in response of Aβ pathology\r\nThese animals will be terminated at 3, 5 and 6 and months of age to depict differences in the levels amyloidosis that could correlate with gene expression, i.e. the anti-GFP-scFv under the control of the GFAP promoter. The brains will be processed as described below.\r\n\r\nSpecific aim 2 - GFAP promoter efficacy in response to FUS \r\nIn 2-month-old nTg mice, PHP.eB.GFAP.anti-GFP-scFv will be delivered intravenously from where it can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach astrocytes of the brain. Three weeks later; a time-point at which transgene expression is high, half the animals will receive monthly FUS application unilaterally to the hippocampus. The contralateral hippocampus will serve as an internal control where the PHP.eB.GFAP.anti-GFAP-scFv can enter but without receiving FUS subsequently Subgroups of animals will be sacrificed at 3, 5 and 6 months of age, having respectively received 1, 2 and 3 FUS treatments and brains processed as described below.\r\n\r\nSpecific aim 3 – Therapeutic rSol expression and efficacy in reducing Aβ pathology\r\nTg mice at 2 months of age will be injected intravenously with PHP.eB.GFAP.rSol, similar to PHP.eB.GFAP.anti-GFP-scFv in Aims 2 and 3. Half the animals will receive additional FUS application(s) as established in Aim 2, and sacrificed at 3, 5, and 6 months of age. Brains processed as described below to determine the ability of rSol delivered at an early age to reduce Aβ pathology in later age. \r\n\r\nMethod \r\nAll procedures are routinely used in the Aubert Lab. Tg mice at 2 months of age will be anaesthetised and injected intravenously with PHP.eB encoding the control anti-GFP-scFv, or the therapeutic rSol, under the control of the GFAP promoter. Animals will be deeply anesthetized, perfused and brains will be removed and processed for sectioning, or dissected in relevant areas to evaluate rSol and anti-GFPscFv mRNA and protein expression by the GFAP promoter, GFAP mRNA and protein levels, as well as soluble and insoluble Aβ. The methodologies include tissue analysis by ELISA and qPCR; and quantitative immunohistochemistry and RNAscope analyses on brain sections. Based on previous studies, 8 animals per group are sufficient to draw conclusion on the quantitative outcome measures above.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nThe development of a regulatable gene therapy approach with high expression of therapeutic genes specifically where and when most needed in the brain will obviate the need for decades of repeated life-interrupting treatments for AD patients. Furthermore, studies have reported a correlation between GFAP expression and other forms of dementia6,7 and the GFAP promoter has been used for the expression of anti-tau antibodies in a mouse model of AD8. Therefore, my proposed gene delivery and regulation approach could provide a new platform for the treatment of AD and other related dementia with unmet regulatory needs.","Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the build-up of toxic substances, termed amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ), in the brain. Aβ damages brain cells, preventing the formation and retrieval of memories. My goal is to deliver a gene to brain cells, making them capable of producing a therapeutic that neutralizes toxic Aβ as disease progresses. Then, I will use ultrasound to stimulate brain cells to increase the production of therapeutics. Brain cells will keep responding to the treatment and to disease progression, producing therapeutics when needed. This approach can revolutionize personalized treatments for patients and improve their quality of life.","Focused Ultrasound, Alzheimer's Disease","GFAP, Expression, SCFV, Gene, Pathology, Age",Alzheimer’s Disease,n,"Amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ), Memory",FUS,Quality of Life,Animal,,"Personalized Treatment, Tech",University of Toronto,2023,22000,13200,,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=4FxcL4YAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinaza-lilian-dibia/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chinaza-Dibia-2,,Univeristy of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anita Szabó,,Jillian Miller,Brain responses to placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia in youth (BRAIN Study),"Rationale: Pediatric chronic pain affects 1 in 4 youth (King et al., 2011). Treatment options for chronic pain have low response rates and are primarily limited to pharmacological options (Colloca, 2018). In 2016, the largest randomized, controlled trial for pediatric chronic pain found similar effects between two established pharmacological therapies and placebo, a substance similar in appearance with no therapeutic value (Powers et al., 2017). A significant amount of clinical improvement is directly attributable to placebo effects due to improvements to physical or mental health after perceived treatment (Kaptchuk & Miller, 2015). Placebo remains the only intervention that is effective for all pain types, and the effect sizes are often large (Colloca, 2018). In contrast, (Blasini, Corsi, Klinger, & Colloca, 2017). Thus, harnessing placebo, and/or reducing nocebo (negativeexpectations of a treatment) effects has significant implications for medical practice. However, imaging studies examining placebo/nocebo effects to date have been primarily conducted in adults (Blasini et al., 2017; Zunhammer, Bingel, Wager, & Placebo Imaging, 2018). In adults,both the placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia integrally engage frontal areas of the brain such as the dorsolateral (DLFPC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Blasini et al., 2017). These regions are associated with cognitive-executive-control and trigger both the descending pain modulatory system and reward systems to diminish or intensify pain, depending on context. Given the immaturity of the adolescent cortex relative to adults (Konrad, Firk, & Uhlhaas, 2013), it is unclear whether the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would be a similarly appropriate target for placebo/nocebo manipulation in youth. Identifying the possibly unique neurological signature pertaining to placebo and nocebo effects in adolescents is becoming of increasing importance. Hypothesis: Similar brain regions will be engaged during the placebo and nocebo responses in adolescents as they are in adults, however, greater prefrontal neuroactivity will be present with increasing age in years. Methods: The present study will use functional neuroimaging to characterize the neurobiology of placebo and nocebo effects in the developing brains of adolescents. Eighty-five healthy youth between the ages of 14-18 years will be recruited to undergo an MRI and sensory testing at the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH). During their lab visit at ACH, a thermal device will be applied to their right arm. Their thresholds for low, moderate, and high pain will be established. A 3x3 arid will be drawn on their forearm, and 3inert (chemically inactive) creams dyed different colours (blue for lidocaine, pink for capsaicin, and white for neutral) will be spread onto three adjacent squares (i.e., one cream for each row). Usingexperimental manipulation, participants will be made to believe that the pink cream induces hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity), and the blue cream induces analgesia (decreased sensitivity). Expectancies and responses to pain will be recorded using self-report and functional MRI measures. This fundamental MRI study will help to identify the neurological signature of placebo/nocebo effects in youth. These results will help to establish neural targets for neurostimulation, which can enhance the placebo effect as a future evidence-based, non-pharmacological, pain management strategy. Impact: The annual cost of pain is greater than the annual costs of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (Gaskin & Richard, 2012). Approximately, 2 out of 3 youths with chronic pain will become adults with chronic pain (Walker, Sherman, Bruehl,Garber, & Smith, 2012). Biotechnologies provide a promising new avenue of treatment for individuals with chronic pain, as pharmacological management for pediatric chronic pain is often ineffective. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) uses low-level electrical signals to stimulate the brain. Recently, Tu et al. demonstrated in adults that tDCS of the right DLPFC could boost placebo, and blunt nocebo effects (Tu et al., 2021). By manipulating placebo and nocebo effects we may be able to noninvasively improve clinical outcomes in patients. However, it is currently unknown whether the right DLPFC would be an appropriate neural target for enhancing the placebo effect and blunting the nocebo effect in youth. Therefore, the present study will explore the neurobiological signatures underlying both the placebo and nocebo effects in youth in order to identify appropriate targets for tDCS. Importantly, given the portability, ease of application, and low cost of tDCS (i.e., $5,450 per device), youth could be treated for their chronic pain regardless of where they live, for the same cost of 1-2 hospitalizations for their pain. The long-term goal of this work is to optimize outcomes for youth with chronic pain by reducing pain intensity, pain disability, and reducing harm from medication overuse.","In adults, brain stimulation is being used to enhance placebo responses, as a possible new strategy to manage pain. However, placebo responses have not been investigated in the brains of youth, so it is unknown whether similar brain targets would be appropriate to manage pediatric pain. Therefore, the present study uses neuroimaging to study placebo responses in youth to identify brain targets for neurostimulation-based placebo enhancement. The long-term goal is to develop new, non- pharmacological pain management strategies for youth with chronic pain.","TMS, Placebo, Pediatric, Pain","Pain, Placebo, Chronic, Youth",n/a,y,Chronic pain,tDCS,"Pediatric, Pain Reduction",Human,,"Tech, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-szab%C3%B3-2b6369302/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arya Raha,,Kristin Musselman,Functional electrical stimulation (FES) walking therapy for adults with cerebral palsy.,"The number of Canadians living with cerebral palsy (CP), the most common childhood motor disorder, is projected to increase from > 75,000 in 2011 to > 94,000 in 2031. [1] CP is caused by damage to the brain acquired before, during or after birth, resulting in permanent motor and sensory impairments. Canadians with CP have a normal life expectancy, yet they require ongoing specialized medical care and supports for assisted living, occupation and education. [1] Children with CP routinely receive rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy; however, adults with CP describe a discontinuity of services in adulthood, despite reporting unmet rehabilitation goals, including the ability to walk safely without falling. [2] About 60% of these individuals are able to walk as they enter adulthood, but more than half report a deterioration in their walking ability as they age, with this decline typically occurring before 35 years of age. [3] Adults with CP have identified impaired balance control as the primary cause of this decline in walking ability. [3] Indeed, 80% of ambulatory adults with CP fall at least once/year, most commonly while walking. [3] Since CP research has focused on children and adolescents, we do not knowhow to help adults with CP maintain or improve their ability to walk safely. [4] To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and acceptance of a novel walking therapy involving functional electrical stimulation (FES) for young adults with CP through a sequential mixed methods pilot study. FES involves applying an electrical current to peripheral nerves to facilitate precisely timed muscle contractions for the retraining of functional movements. We hypothesize that the novel walking therapy will be: 1) efficacious, as demonstrated by improved performance on clinical measures of walking and balance post-therapy, and 2) acceptable to adults with CP, as demonstrated by participant responses to a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). [5] We also hypothesize that the quantitative findings collected through the clinical measures and questionnaire will be corroborated by the voices of participants elicited through semi-be corroborated by the voices of participants elicited through semi-structured interviews. Five ambulatory adults with spastic CP, aged 18-39 years, will attend one-hour therapy sessions two times/week for 6 weeks. The therapy will involve repetitive practice of challenging walking and balance exercises while FES is applied to participants' leg muscles. Up to four channels of electrical stimulation will be delivered, with the stimulation synchronized to the participant's steps through pressure sensors in the shoes. The FES will be personalized for each individual depending on their deficits in walking and lower limb strength, as determined by a physical therapist at an initial assessment. Participants will be secured in an overhead harness and spotted by a physical therapist throughout the sessions for safety. The following measures will be collected before and immediately after the therapy program: spatiotemporal gait parameters (Zeno Walkway), walking speed (10-meter(Zeno Walkway), walking speed (10-meter Walk Test), standing and walking balance control (mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test) and balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale). Each participant's change score (i.e., post-therapy score - pre-therapy score) will be compared to the minimal detectable change and/or minimally important clinical difference for each measure. The TAM questionnaire will be administered immediately after the therapy program and analyzed with descriptive statistics. A semi-structured interview will be completed one-month post-therapy. The interview will query participants' perceptions of the appropriateness, meaningfulness and impacts of the walking therapy, as well as ask how the therapy could be improved. Athematic analysis will be applied to analyze the interview data. The qualitative findings will be compared with the quantitative results to identify complementary, convergent, and/or divergent findings. [6] The pilot study findings will be used to design an acceptable and meaningful walking therapy for adults with CP, as well as inform the design of a larger randomized clinical trial. FES technology is rarely used with the adult CP population, despite it being an effective adjunct to movement-based rehabilitation for other non-progressive neurological conditions. If this novel walking therapy if effective, it can be translated into clinical environments relatively quickly as the technology has high clinical utility. Improving and/or maintaining the walking ability of Canadian adults with CP will have a significant, positive impact on these individuals, their families and the healthcare system. The healthcare expenditures of adults with CP are 7-10 times greater than that of Canadian adults without CP.[1] Improving safe mobility may reduce their healthcare costs, as greater walking ability will decrease the occurrence of health complications related to immobility.","With up to 80% of ambulatory adults with CP falling once a year, it is critical that we focus on providing personalized walking therapy for these individuals. Functional electrical stimulus (FES) entails applying electrical currents that are precisely timed with muscle contractions to help retrain functional movements. We are developing a novel walking therapy for young adults with CP which we will then evaluate the efficacy of in collaboration with people with CP and physical therapists that treat this population. Our quantitative data will also be supported through patient voices collected through semi-structured interviews. By creating a personalized therapeutic approach by tailoring FES to everyone along with collecting data to speak to the feasibility and acceptance of this intervention. Our study lays the groundwork to inform larger randomized control studies for meaningful walking therapy for adults living with CP.","Electrical Stimulation, Cerebral Palsy","Walking, Adults, Balance, Ability, FES",Cerebral Palsy,n,"Motor, Sensory",FES,Walking Therapy,Human,,"Tech, Personalized Treatment",University of Toronto,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/arya-raha-7a0a97205/,,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sarah Mina,,Leah Mayo,Mechanisms supporting psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for alcohol use disorder ,"Rationale Alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in Canada, and 1 in 5 Canadians (age 15+) will meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in their lifetime[1]. Current pharmacological treatments for AUD have low efficacy, as many require complicated dosing regimens or sustained patient adherence |2,3,4], so innovative treatments are needed. Growing evidence suggests that psilocybin, a naturally occurring hallucinogen, may reduce alcohol consumption in AUD when administered alongside motivational enhancement therapy (MET), a brief and manualized behavioral intervention that employs strategies to evoke internally motivated reductions in substance use [5,6]. For example, in a recent RCT, 2 doses of psilocybin paired with 12 weeks of MET was found to be more effective than MET plus an active control (diphenhydramine) at reducing heavy drinking days[7]. Methods: The purpose of this study is to replicate and extend preliminary research by determining whether a single 25mg dose of psilocybin followed by 5 sessions of weekly MET, compared to a single 1 mg active control dose plus MET, can reduce alcohol consumption in a treatment-seeking AUD population. Participants (N=128; 22-64 years old) will berandomized to one of the active/high dose (n=64) or active control (n=64) psilocybin conditions, and both the participants and research staff (therapists and investigators) will be blinded to the treatment condition until the entire study is complete. The primary aim is to test the changes in alcohol consumption between groups, as measured by percent heavy drinking days at 1-, 4-, and 12-weeks post-dosing. We will secondarily collect measures of self-reported days abstinent, objective blood markers of alcohol consumption[8], as well as metrics of AUD severity[9], quality of life[10], functioning[11], disability[12], and adverse events. Our secondary aim is to assess effects of the active psilocybin dose (25mg), compared to the active control (1 mg), together with MET, on alcohol-related behavioral deficits which are often obstacles to successful AUD treatment, including cue-induced alcohol craving and cognitive flexibility[13-17] at 1-, 4-, and 12-weeks post-dosing. Our third aim is to assess changes in glutamate and GABA in the anterior cingulate cortex, from baseline to 1-week post-dosing, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Beyond reduction in alcohol consumption, there is no existing clinical evidence for how psilocybin may influence alcohol-related behaviors. It is known that in animal models, a single administration of psilocybin can reduce cue reactivity and improve cognitive flexibility via a glutamate-dependentreactivity and improve cognitive flexibility via a glutamate-dependent mechanism[18,19], but the effects of psilocybin on GABA are unknown. Mechanistically, craving in AUD has been associated with an imbalance in glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and metabolism[20,21]. This study is novel in exploring psilocybin-induced changes in both glutamate and GABA as a mechanism for psilocybin's effects on drinking behavior and craving. This study design will eliminate a number of limitations present in previous studies. The previous RCT using psilocybin alongside MET have administered 12 sessions of weekly MET[7]. However, MET was designed to consist of weekly sessions for about a month, so we will use 5 weeks of MET, which reduces the burden on both patients and clinics. The previous RCT also utilized diphenhydramine as a placebol/]. However, since the subjective effects of the placebo and psychedelic are distinct, many patients and staff correctly guessed their condition, resulting in participant expectations in the psychedelic group, which impacts treatment outcomes. Thus, we will use an active group (25mg) and active control group (1mg), informing all participants that they will be receivingpsilocybin, thereby controlling for expectancy effects between groups. Hypotheses For the primary aim, we hypothesize that compared to the active control dose of psilocybin + MET, treatment with a single active dose of psilocybin+ MET will reduce the number of heavy drinking days and improve secondary metrics of functioning. For the second aim, we hypothesize that the active dose group will exhibit reduced cue-reactive craving and improvements in cognitive flexibility. For the third aim, we hypothesize that compared to the pre-treatment baseline session, the active dose group will exhibit decreased glutamate and increased GABA levels. Potential impact This study will improve the implementation of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for AUD in three ways. Firstly, by using an active controlassistea psycnoter apy for AUD n three ways. Firstly, by using an active control approach, we can have better control over participant expectancy effects that may otherwise conflate effect sizes. Secondly, by improving feasibility by using a shorter MET regimen, and thirdly, by identifying the mechanisms supporting reduction in alcohol consumption. This trial will provide realistic effect sizes, in addition to potential mechanisms of action, which will be crucial in designing subsequent phase-3 trials and ultimately, the development of a novel treatment strategy.","In this review, we utilized a scoping review framework to map what is known about the relationship between acute psychedelic experiences and therapeutic outcomes. We analyzed published studies, like clinical trials and retrospective studies, to explore what measures researchers utilized to quantify the acute experience, which outcomes they studied, and if they reported statistical relationships between the acute experience and outcome. We also wanted to assess the quality of these studies and the strength of the relationships, and if the relationship differs by population and/or type of psychedelic.","Psychedelics, Alcohol Use, fMRI","Active, Psilocybin, Alcohol, Glutamate, GABA",Alcohol Use Disorder,y,Motivation,"Psychedelics, Psilocybin, Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)",Treatment,Human,,"Nutraceutical, Mind and Body",University of Calgary ,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-mina-7b0259213/?originalSubdomain=ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colin Murray,,Marie-Ève Tremblay,Investigating the impact acute inhalation of cannabis with a high content of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol has on myelination and microglia in adult and aged mice,"Background\r\nDue to a combination of legalization, destigmatization and increased accessibility, cannabis consumption in North America has seen a steady rise over the past few decades. Specifically, the senior demographic (≥65-year-old) is increasing their consumption at an elevated rate compared to other age groups (1,2). However, research investigating aged individuals who consume cannabis is extremely lacking. Cannabinoids—the main biologically active compounds found in cannabis—bind to endocannabinoid receptors throughout the body (3). A well-known role of the endocannabinoid system is the activity-dependent inhibition of neurotransmitter release from the pre-synaptic terminals of neurons (4). However, endocannabinoid receptors are also abundant on glial cells like microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain (5). Research has shown the ability for cannabinoids like delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) to alter microglial function in adolescent and adult mice (6,7). Additionally, cannabinoids interact with other glial cells like the myelinating oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); promoting differentiation and enhancing myelination at certain doses in adult mice (8-10). Myelination is a complex process that involves the wrapping of myelin—a lipid rich sheath—around the axons of neurons to enhance electrical transmission. Microglia also play an important role in the process of myelination and were shown to directly contact the nodes of Ranvier—unmyelinated sections of the axon that propagate electrical signals—in an activity-dependent manner, which has been linked to enhanced myelination (11-13). Additionally, it is now apparent that myelination is adaptable and partly guided by changes in neuronal activity during lived experiences, contributing to brain plasticity and behaviour (14-16). Therefore, with the ability for THC to alter neuronal activity, OPC differentiation, and glial cell function, cannabis consumption likely has an impact on the process of adaptive myelination, effectively altering communication networks in the brain. Furthermore, myelin deteriorates in the aging brain, which has been linked to cognitive decline (17-19). However, the impact cannabis may have during this period of degeneration is not well understood. \r\nWith the evident links between THC, glial cells, and myelination, this project aims to explore how acute exposure to inhaled cannabis impacts myelination in the brain of adult and aged mice. This study will provide essential data to compare against chronically exposed mice and mice exposed to different levels of cannabinoids found in cannabis.\r\n\r\nHypothesis\r\nAcute exposure to cannabis with a high content of THC will reduce microglial contacts with the nodes of Ranvier and influence oligodendrocyte differentiation, and may lead to small but significant changes in myelination. These hypotheses will be tested through three highly complementary aims:\r\n\r\nAim 1. Examine how acute exposure to THC may alter microglial interactions with the nodes of Ranvier and oligodendrocyte lineage cells.\r\nAim 2. Examine how acute exposure to THC may alter myelin content and ultrastructure.\r\nAim 3. Examine how acute exposure to THC may alter oligodendrocyte lineage cell populations.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nMale and female C57BL\/6J mice (~2.5 and ~18-month-old) will be acutely exposed via passive vapour administration in closed chambers to cannabis flower (25-31% THC; &lt;1% CBD) acquired from the Ontario Cannabis Store, or vehicle air. Animals will be euthanized 30 minutes post-exposure when THC levels peak in the brain (20). All animal work will be performed in Dr. Jibran Khokhar’s laboratory at the University of Guelph\/Western University. All experiments will have a sample size of 4-5 mice\/sex\/group. The regions of interest are the forceps minor and the genu of the corpus callosum—white matter structures that connect cortical regions rich in cannabinoid receptors that are associated with attention and working memory (21).\r\nAny large-scale changes in deposited myelin will be quantified by measuring white matter using immunofluorescence against myelin basic protein (MBP), one of the most common proteins in myelin. The density and maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells will be analyzed using immunofluorescence against the markers Olig2 (pan-oligodendrocyte lineage marker), PDGFR-alpha (specific to OPCs) and CC1 (specific to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes), followed by epifluorescence microscopy with an Apotome. Olig2(+)\/PDGFR-alpha(+)\/CC1(-) co-labeling corresponds to OPCs and Olig2(+)\/PDGFR-alpha(-)\/CC1(+) to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Microglial contacts with the nodes of Ranvier will be visualized using staining for IBA1 (microglia\/macrophages), Nav1.6 (sodium channels prevalent at the nodes of Ranvier) and MBP by confocal microscopy. Lastly, the ultrastructure of myelin, microglia, and their interactions with other glial cells and myelinated axons will be assessed by scanning electron microscopy, followed by quantitative analysis (22). This step is crucial to begin to understand the minute changes that may occur in myelination after acute cannabis exposure, and will provide mechanistic insights into early changes induced by cannabis. Microglia will be labeled using IBA1 prior to image acquisition with the scanning electron microscope. A three-way ANOVA will determine if sex significantly contributes to the results. If not, a two-way ANOVA will be used to determine statistically significant differences between age and treatment groups.\r\nThis work will be supervised by Dr. Marie-Ève Tremblay, a world leader in neuroimmunology and Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Aging and Cognition. My role in this study will involve experimental design and execution, analysis, and manuscript preparation, with support from the Tremblay lab. Additionally, I will also visit Dr. Khokhar’s laboratory to learn first-hand the in vivo procedures performed. \r\n\r\nSignificance and Academic Impact\r\nMyelination is essential for brain activity and plasticity, while its alteration may critically underlie the cognitive decline commonly observed with aging. However, the impact cannabis consumption has on microglia, oligodendrocyte lineage cells and their outcomes on myelination in the adult and aged brain has not been extensively studied yet. Therefore, increased research is necessary to inform the public and healthcare professionals about the potential impact of this widely-used substance on myelination in the brain. Furthermore, it is imperative to better equip policy makers with relevant information on the potential impacts of this substance. Results from this study will also begin to lay down the foundation for how cannabis may impact myelination in the aged brain, and will stimulate research into cannabis consumption in the aged demographic, a highly understudied population in cannabis research.","In recent decades, the consumption of cannabis has become increasingly normalised, and usage has increased in certain demographics, especially seniors (≥65-year-old). However, research focusing on the impact cannabis consumption has on the aged brain is extremely scarce, as research hitherto has focused on developmental time points. This study sets out to understand how an acute exposure to cannabis impacts non-neuronal cells and their critical involvement with myelination in the adult and aged brain of mice. This study will provide vital information about the impact cannabis consumption has on brain health in maturing populations.","Aging, Cannabis, Alzheimer's Disease","Cannabis, Myelination, THC, Brain, Oligodendrocyte",n/a,n,Mylenation,Cannabis,Aging,Animal,,"Nutraceutical, Personalized Treatment",University of Victoria,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-murray-24105021b,,https://neuroimmuneplasticity.ca/,University of Victoria,,,,colinmur@uvic.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arpsima Aziz,,Mark Boulos,Strengthening Oropharyngeal Muscles as a Novel Approach to Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Rationale and Academic Impact: Approximately 20% of the general population has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)' and it is estimated that nearly five million Canadians suffer from OSA.? OSA is characterized by recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep,' which exposes the body to harmful physiological stressors such as nocturnal oxygen desaturation, arousals from sleep, and intrathoracic pressure changes.* OSA puts patients at an increased risk of early death,$ stroke,' myocardial infarction, depressive symptoms, high blood pressure, daytime sleepiness,' cognitive dysfunction,® and a greater chance of motor vehicle collisions.' Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains as the gold-standard treatment for OSA, its benefits are offset by poor adherence (e.g. only 30% compliance after 3 months).'° Moreover, CPAP is aerosol-generating, making it anCPAP is aerosol-generating, making it an unfavourable modality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other OSA treatments such as weight loss, bariatric surgery and mandibular advancement devices are either invasive, expensive or require long-term patient motivation. There is an emergingtrend in clinical practice that calls for alternative treatment options for patients who are noncompliant to CAP. OSA is primarily induced by decreased upper airway and hypopharyngeal muscle tone during sleep. Several studies have suggested that oropharyngeal exercises (OPEs) derived from speech-language pathology can be used to strengthen the airways as an alternative treatment method."" However, two recent systematic reviews concluded that the existing studies that have explored the role of oropharyngeal exercises as a potential alternative treatment strategy for OSA were limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity of the interventions examined, and high risk of bias (e.g. limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity of the interventions examined, and high risk of bias (e.g. unblinded studies).""1, 12 An adequately-powered, double-blinded study that addresses limitations in the current literature is needed to establish whether oropharyngeal exercises are efficacious in reducing OSA severity. Our current study will serve as a pilot study for a future larger study that will address gaps in the current literature by being adequately powered, methodologically robust, and the largest study to-date to examine the efficacy of oropharyngeal exercises in treating OSA. Methodology: Population: This pilot study aims to recruit approximately 40 participants with OSA who were unable to tolerate a minimum 2-week CPAP trial.Exclusion criteria includes: significant cognitive impairment; depression; use of hypnotic medications; diseases impacting speech or oropharyngeal muscles; diseases or devices (e.g. oxygen therapy) that could interfere with a home sleep apnea test.Intervention and Comparison: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive exercises guided by a tablet-based app, either as part of the intervention or control group. The intervention group receives a daily regimen of 10 standard OPEs that have been developed from speech-language pathology and have demonstrated effectiveness in previousdemonstrated effectiveness in previous studies in OSA patients. treatment group performs mouth movements that do not impact oropharyngeal strength. Both groups will be instructed to complete OPE/sham regimens for 30 minutes/day and 5 days/week for 6 weeks.13 Outcome: The primary outcome of this pilot study is the feasibility of delivering OPEs for OSA patients. Specifically, we will use our app to track a) the number times a participant completes an OPE and b) the percentage of participants who complete at least 80% their OPE regimen. We will also evaluate recruitment and consent rates. Thesecondary outcomes assess the effectiveness of OPEs in decreasing the severity of OSA, which will provide preliminary data informing future studies in the field. At baseline, post-training (6 weeks) and retention (10 weeks), we will measure each participant's OSA severity through use of the home sleep apnea test and sleep-related symptoms through standardized questionnaires. Hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: At least 80% of participants will complete 80% of their assigned regimen, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for future larger randomized controlled trials to assess treatment efficacy. Hypothesis 2: Compared to the sham activities, OPEs will improve OSA severity and sleep quality. Feasibility Considerations: Although pilot studies do not require power calculations, we havealready recruited 10/40 participants of our target sample size. This study's principal investigator, Dr. Mark Boulos, runs a clinic seeing >400 OSA patients/year, from which he has identified an additional 30 participants who are ready for enrollment. The plan is to recruit another 10 patients prior to the summer, and I will assist with recruiting the remaining 20 patients during the summer term. We have also mitigated the technical uncertainties arising from COVID-19 restrictions by designing an app-based intervention and obtaining Research Ethics Board approval to conduct the study fully virtually, should the need arise.",,"Speech-Language Therapy, Sleep Apnea, App","Sleep, Oropharyngeal, Exercises, Intervention, Speech",Obstructive Sleep Apnea,y,Sleep,"Oropharyngeal Exercises, Speech Therapy","Assessment, Quality of Life",Human,,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2023,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Arpsima-Aziz-2272040387,,McMaster University?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emerson Daniele,,Maryam Faiz,The gut-microbiota-astrocyte-axis in stroke,"Background: \r\n\tAstrocytes, a type of glial cell in the central nervous system (CNS), respond to all forms of CNS injury and disease. In response to stroke, it is well known that astrocytes undergo complex molecular and morphological changes that allow them to play critical roles in injury resolution and repair[1]. Reactive astrocytes can regulate blood-brain barrier permeability [9], seal off damaged tissue[2], contribute to inflammation[3], repair the vasculature and extracellular matrix[4], and remodel neuronal synapses and axons [5], [6]. While it is well known that these ‘reactive’ astrocytes contribute to both tissue damage and repair, the molecular identities of the astrocyte populations involved, and the mechanisms that control them are less well understood. A critical question is what host factors can modulate astrocyte states?\r\n\tExcitingly, the gut microbiota, the collection of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a mediator of astrocyte state acquisition. In a seminal study, the microbial metabolite, tryptophan, was shown to suppress astrocytic neuroinflammatory gene expression and improve functional outcomes in a rodent model of Multiple Sclerosis[7]. Another recent study also demonstrated altered astrocyte reactivity in a germ-free mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease, characterized by a shift in astrocyte states and morphology [8]. This may suggest the existence of a gut-microbiota-reactive astrocyte axis across diverse neurological conditions.  While it is known that stroke changes gut microbiota composition in both mouse models and human survivors[9], [10] and that the gut microbiota influences stroke outcome [9], [11], how the gut microbiota modulates astrocyte reactivity in stroke is not known. \r\n\tIn prior studies, our lab has established that reactive astrocytes exhibit heterogeneity in their response to stroke over time, however, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota is a driver of this heterogeneity. Therefore, in this proposal, we will examine how the gut microbiota impacts the baseline heterogeneity of astrocytes in adulthood (Aim 1) and in response to stroke (Aim 2). Understanding how the gut drives astrocyte responses to injury offers a potential avenue for developing novel gut-informed therapies for brain repair.\r\n\r\nAim 1: How does gut colonization status influence transcriptional states of astrocytes in adulthood? \r\nRationale: Astrocytes are a heterogenous population of cells with diverse transcriptional identities, however, the mechanisms responsible for establishing this heterogeneity are only beginning to be appreciated[12]. It is known that the gut microbiota can regulate the proper development and diversity of many other CNS cell types (neurons, microglia) [13], [14] but whether the gut microbiota impacts the establishment of astrocyte diversity is unknown. We hypothesize that there are gut-dependent astrocyte identities and will use the cerebral cortex as a model system for understanding these interactions. Moreover, this Aim will establish a framework to understand how the gut mediates the astrocyte response to injury in Aim 2. \r\n\r\nMethodology: To study whether gut colonization impacts astrocyte heterogeneity in adulthood, we will perform scRNAseq on cortical astrocytes isolated from 8-12-week-old male and female C57BL6 (n=5 pooled\/group) mice with different gut colonization statuses across the lifespan: i) germ-free (GF) mice which have no gut microbiota during development and adulthood, ii) ex-germ free (Ex-GF) mice which have no microbiota during development but are colonized with specific pathogen-free (SPF) gut microbiota in adulthood, iii) SPF antibiotic (SPF-Abx) mice which have gut microbiota during development but not during adulthood and iv) control SPF mice which have gut microbiota throughout their life. Using bioinformatics pipelines, we will determine the molecular profiles of astrocytes that depend on colonization status. Specifically, we will identify astrocytes populations that depend on colonization during (i) development (present in SPF and SPF-Abx but absent in Ex-GF and GF datasets), (ii) adulthood (present in SPF and Ex-GF but absent in SPF-Abx and GF datasets), as well as (iii) astrocyte states that are present regardless of colonization (populations that are found in all groups). We will also examine whether there are shifts in astrocyte populations that are still present across the experimental groups. Finally, we will validate the top 5 genes that define these gut-colonization-dependent or independent astrocyte states using protein analysis (IHC\/Western Blot) and gene expression analysis (ddPCR, RNAscope). \r\n\r\nAim 2: How does gut colonization status influence astrocyte state acquisition in response to injury?\r\n\r\nRationale: In rodent models of stroke, alterations in lesion size and functional outcomes are influenced by gut microbiota colonization[10]. Given that the gut microbiota can influence the astrocyte response to other CNS insults, [8,15] we hypothesize that gut colonization drives reactive astrocyte state acquisition in response to ischemic stroke. As the astrocyte response to stroke evolves over time[16], we will use scRNAseq to examine the interaction of gut colonization status and time on astrocytes in stroke. \r\n\r\nMethodology: We will induce ischemic stroke using the endothelin-1 model of stroke injury [17] using animals from the colonization paradigms outlined in Aim 1. We will perform scRNAseq on cortical astrocytes isolated from the injured hemisphere of 5 animals\/group at acute (day 4 post-stroke, d4) and subacute (d10) timepoints following injury. To identify gut-responsive reactive astrocyte states, we will merge all our datasets collected here with “baseline” datasets generated in Aim 1. As in Aim 1, we will use our bioinformatics pipeline to identify the molecular profiles of gut-responsive astrocytes and how they change over time (baseline (Aim1), d4, d10). With proportion analysis of our clusters, we will identify: i) ‘gut-independent’ states (present but unchanged in SPF, SPF-Abx, GF, and Ex-GF mice), and ii) ‘gut-responsive’ states. These may comprise gut-dependent states that relate to colonization in development (absent in GF and Ex-GF but present in SPF and SPF-Abx datasets) or adulthood (absent in Ex-SPF and GF but present in Ex-GF and SPF datasets). This will allow us to identify how astrocyte states differ in response to injury over time based on gut colonization status. Again, we will perform validation experiments for the top 5 gene pathways using protein and gene expression analyses.","Stroke is a devastating brain disease and is one of the leading causes of disability in Canada. There are few effective treatments for stroke survivors, highlighting the need to identify new therapies. Exciting research has shown that the bacteria that live in the gut can produce factors that can influence astrocytes, a type of brain cell that responds to injury. Currently, it is unknown how gut bacteria influence astrocytes in the context of stroke. By understanding this relationship, we can develop targeted gut bacteria therapies to promote beneficial astrocyte types to improve recovery in stroke patients.","Inflamation, Gut-Brain Axis, Stroke","Gut, Astrocytes, SPF, Stroke, GF",Stroke,n,"Inflammation, Astrocytes, Central Nervous System",Gut Bacteria,Gut-Brain Axis,Animal,,Nutraceutical,University of Toronto,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/emerson-daniele-817456b7/,,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Ashley de Witte,,Maryam Faiz,investigating the effects of butyric acid treatment post-stroke on the transcriptomic states of microglia,"Rationale: Microglia are the resident innate immune cell of the central nervous system (CNS) that play an integral role in mediating the immune response to CNS injuries, such as stroke (Yu et al., 2020).Interestingly, microglia exhibit temporally dynamic phenotypes which can contribute to both the exacerbation of tissue damage as well as tissue repair over time post-injury (Kawabori & Yenari, 2015) These phenotypes and their associated effector functions have been characterized by cellular morphology and transcriptomic profiles. However, the host factors that contribute to the establishment of diverse microglial phenotypes are only beginning to be studied and may provide a new avenue for microglial-based brain repair strategies (Masuda et al., 2020). Excitingly, it has been shown that the collection of microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract the aut microbiota, is a driver ofmicroglial phenotypes in stroke injury (Singh et al., 2018, Sadler et al., 2020). It is now well understood that stroke injury results in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and associated alterations in the production of microbial metabolites that influence CNS function. Specifically, gutdysbiosis is associated with reduced short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, a byproduct of fibre fermentation, which is associated with worsened outcomes following injury in pre-clinical models (Tan et al., 2021). A few recent studies have demonstrated that both pre-and post-stroke butyric acid treatments have a positive effect on stroke outcomes (Sadler et al., 2020; Park & Sohrabji 2016), and may suggest a role for microglia in SCFA-mediated recovery. For example, butyrate treatment is associated with functional recovery, and the upregulation of microglial activation genes (Sadler et al., 2020). However, the types of microglia thatare affected by butyrate, and the host cues that mediate this response remain unknown. Our overarching hypothesis is that butyrate drives the acquisition of pro-recovery microglia types that are defined by a characteristic morphology and molecular profile. In this proposal, we will use a novel spatially resolved single-cell - omics technique, called ev-DISCO (ex vivo- Digital Isolation of cells for -omics; developed by Aaron Wheelers lab, University of Toronto) to examine molecular and morphological profiles of microglia in response to post-stroke butyric acid therapy. Methods: We will induce stroke in 8_10-week-old male andinduce stroke in 8-10-week-old male and female C57L6 mice using the endothelin- 1 model of ischemic stroke (Dojo Soeandy et al., 2019, Roome et al., 2014). Immediately following stroke or sham injury, animals will be provided with sodium butyrate (40 M) or sodium chloride (40 um) in the drinking water, ad libitum, until day 4 post-injury (D4). At D4, we will harvest the brain tissue from animals and perform immunohistochemistry for microglial markers (Iba1, TMEM119), for downstream analysis with ev-DISCO. Prior to single cell capture with evDISCO we will take 40X confocal stacks to perform a Scholl analysis of morphology. We will then use ev-DISCOvarious distances from the stroke lesion site; i)0-100 um, ii) 100-200um and, iii) > 200 pm. Single-cell lysates will be used for downstream RNA sequencing. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that i) Iba 1+TMEM199+ microglia will exhibit diverse morphological and transcriptomically distinct subsets that relate to the distance from the stroke injury site and, ii) butyric acid will shift the relative proportions of ""pro-recovery"" microglial populations. Potential Impact: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in Canada (Krueger et al., 2015). Ischemic stroke comprises around 80% of all strokes (Kuriakose & Xiao, 2020). It is caused by areduction of blood flow to the brain that results in neural cell death and inflammation, and consequent deficits in function. Unfortunately, current treatments are limited and can only be administered in a fraction of patients due to a very narrow therapeutic time window (Kuriakose & Xiao, 2020). In potentially further elucidating the mechanisms behind the functional recovery following butyric acid treatment, this work may inform the targeted application of microbiome-based treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions and may reveal specific functional pathways that may be targeted to improve the precision of treatment beyond current microbiome approaches.",,"Microbiome, Stroke, Inflammation","Injury, Microglia, Recovery, Acid, Butyrate, Phenotypes",Stroke,n,Microglia,Butyrate,"Nutrition, Treatment",Animal,,Nutraceutical,University of Toronto,2023,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-de-witte-142807237/,,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lucia Javorcikova,,Matthew Hill,Effects of early-life adversity and consistent cannabis usage during adolescence on brain development and anxiety-like behaviour in male and female rats,"Cannabis is a common drug that is frequently used among adolescents in Canada. Recent data reports from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drug Use Survey (CSTADS) outline that 28% of individuals in grade 12 and 53% of young adults have used cannabis in the past year (CSTADS, 2018). Cannabis acts directly on the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a system present in both the brain and body (Katona & Freund, 2012). The eCB system is responsible for regulating the stress response system, lowering the immune system, regulating metabolism and feeding, and reducing pain perception (Katona & Freund, 2012). More specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, interacts with the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) to alter release of various neurotransmitters across the brain that drive cognitive behaviours and emotional responses (Katona & Freund, 2012). CB1 receptors have the highest expression during the adolescent period, a complex and often stressful period of development (Heng et al., 2011). Previous clinical work has found associations between the onset of mental health disorders and regular cannabis exposure during adolescence; however, a causal connection has been difficult to prove (Heng et al., 2017; Copeland et al., 2013; Gobbi et al., 2019; Yucel et al., 2008). Stressful life experiences are consistent in the literature as one of the highest risk factors for development of mental health disorders (Heim et al., 2010). Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with early-life adversity (ELA) accounting for over 30% of the risk attributed to development of these disorders (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015; Green et al., 2010). Furthermore, stress has been linked to increasing the use of cannabis in adolescents (Heron et al., 2013; Hyman & Sinha, 2009). Therefore, prior stress exposure could either explain or exacerbate the association between cannabis use and the onset of mental health issues in adolescence ((Heim et al., 2010; Heron et al., 2013). Using an animal model, the proposed research will focus on the effects of consistent cannabis use during adolescence following ELA to determine if prior stress alters the effect of cannabis exposure on the developing brain, along with subsequent behaviour. \r\nThis research will combine a proven rodent model of ELA (low bedding and nesting material) with adolescent cannabis exposure (using a validated vapour inhalation system [La Jolla Alcohol Research Inc]) (Rice et al., 2008; Raineki et al., 2012; Raineki et al., 2017; Baglot et al., 2021; Javadi-Paydar et al., 2018). This model of ELA has been shown to induce inconsistent maternal care and elevate stress hormone levels in offspring (Rice et al., 2008). Furthermore, the cannabis exposure protocol has been experimentally shown to mimic the blood THC levels seen in humans and uses the method of delivery most similar to that of human usage, inhalation (Lee et al., 2013). Firstly, dams and their litters will be assigned to one of two groups from postnatal day (P) 8-12: 1) early-life adversity (adverse growth condition) where only a small amount of bedding\/nesting material is provided on a mesh platform above the cage floor; or, 2) control (normal rearing conditions) where an adequate amount of bedding\/nesting material is provided and no mesh platform. Following ELA, offspring will be weaned on P21 and pair-housed by sex and stress exposure until adolescent exposure. A pre-exposure magnetic resonance image (MRI) will be taken on P25. Secondly, to closely parallel adolescent cannabis usage, male and female rats will then be randomly assigned to receive either daily cannabis or daily vehicle vapour exposure for the entire adolescent period (P28 to P70). Cannabis exposure will be delivered daily across a 15-min session with exposure to moderate potency THC-heavy cannabis extract (150 mg\/ml THC or ~15% THC; Aphria Inc). Vehicle exposure will receive the same daily 15-min session with exposure to vehicle (polyethylene glycol [PEG]) vapour.Following the cannabis exposure protocol, a number of endpoints will be taken. On P75, a post-exposure MRI to evaluate structural brain development changes in cortical and subcortical regions related to stress, emotional regulation, and learning\/memory. MRI data will be compared to pre-exposure scans to examine developmental changes, as well as across groups to examine the effects of ELA and\/or cannabis exposure. On P80, anxiety-like behaviour will be assessed in the elevated plus maze task, which is a standardized ten-minute task in which rats choose between exploring two closed arms (a protected and safe area) or two open arms (a riskier area), with more time in the closed arms an indication of higher anxiety-like behaviour. Behaviour will be scored and compared between groups. Following elevated plus maze, rats will be euthanized and whole brains and blood collected to assess brain activity in anxiety-related brain regions (such as the amygdala) and stress hormone levels.\r\nFindings from this research will strengthen the current body of information regarding the use and safety of cannabis during adolescence. Alongside this, paired with a stress model our research may help determine potential factors linking or exacerbating the relationship between cannabis use and mental health disorders. This work will provide more information on the risk posed when using cannabis during the critical period of brain development in adolescents, which could be integrated into youth educational programs to connect scientific findings to the general public.","Approximately 53% of young adults report using cannabis in the past year. Human research indicates a correlation between mental health disorders, such as anxiety, and daily cannabis use. Stressful life experiences are one of the highest risk factors for development of anxiety disorders and stress has been linked to increased use of cannabis. Therefore, prior stress could explain or exacerbate the association between cannabis use and onset of mental health disorders in adolescence. An animal model will be utilized to examine whether the combination of early-life stress and adolescent cannabis exposure can cause brain maturation changes leading to anxiety behaviours.","Early Life Trauma, Cannabis, Anxiety","Cannabis, Stress, Early-Life Adversity (ELA), Development, Adolescent, THC","""Anxiety, Stress""",y,Cognition,Cannabis,"Brain Maturation, Development",Animal,Basic,"Nutraceutical, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucia-javorcikova-07b728157/,,https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/hbito/hbito,University of Calgary,,,,lucia.javorcikova@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel Andres,,Robert Laprairie,Moving beyond THC and CBD: Testing dosage effects of novel cannabinoid THCP,"In October 2018, the codification of the Cannabis Act introduced the legal sale, possession, and non-medical use of cannabis(1). The Cannabis sativa plant contains over 120 constituent cannabinoids(2). The effects of phytocannabinoids are conferred to the body by the cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R. The activation of the CB1R receptor has been demonstrated to produce the effects associated with the stereotypic psychoactive and thereaputic effects of cannabis and cannabindoids(3), The CB1R receptor is associated with motor control, cognition and memory, and analgesia and phytocannabinoid agonism of the CB1R receptor results in catalepsy, depression of motor activity, analgesia, and feelings of relaxation(4). Although the psychotropic effects, intoxicating potential, and adverse effects of cannabinoids such as THC and CBD are well documented in the literature, additional research is needed to understand the characteristics of other cannabinoids, such as 49-tetrahydrocannabipherol (THCP). THCP is a novel cannabinoid that has been shown to have higher cannabinoidmetric activity than THC(2). Earlier analysis of THCP via cannabinoid tetrad pharmacological tests have led to speculation that THCP may be responsible for pharmacological properties of certain varieties of cannabis that are not attributed to THC (2). The aim of this project is to generate in vivo pilot data that may help determine the intoxication equivalency of the phytocannabinoid THCP to THC. Data will be collected based on behavioral assessments and cannabinoid concentration in the plasma at Cmax. Behavioral testing will be ascertained using a preclinical model known as the cannabinoid-induced mouse tetrad that is used to ascertain CB1R activity. The tetrad is comprised of four phenotypes associated with CB1R agonism: hypo-locomotion, hypothermia, catalepsy, and analgesia. Understanding the cannabinoidmetric activity of THCP, and other cannabinoids, at the CB1R receptor is imperative to establishing intoxication equivalencies for the cannabinoid and developing regulatory controls that reflect the benefits and adverse affects of the cannabinoid. Phase 1: Pharmacokinetic dose-response assessment with be performed in adult (8-12 weeks) male and female C56Bl/6 mice. Assays will be performed with n = 4animals per sex and treatment group. Mice will be treated with 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg compound i.p. once. The Cmax and tmax values determined from previous pharmacokinetic time course experiments will be used as a blood sampling time point for all subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses. Resulting data will be analyzed to determine plasma concentrations at Tmax for THC and THCP to establish equivalency ratios. Phase 2: Subsequently, the pharmacodynamic dose-response assessment will occur using the cannabinoid-induced mouse tetrad to assess subiect response to THC and THCP. This component of the experiment will be performed in adult (8-12 weeks) male and female C56Bl/6 mice and assays will be performed with n = 4 animals per sex and treatment group. Mice will be treated with 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg compound i.p. once. The tetrad consists of tests of catalepsy, body temperature, nociception, and locomotion. Catalepsy will be assessed via the bar hold assay, administered 27 minutes after dosing while body temperature will be assessed via rectal thermometer 29 minutes after compound administration. 30 minutes after compound administration, nociception will be tested by tail-withdraw reaction time when the distal tail is placed in 52°C water. Finally, locomotion will be assessed 31 minutes after compound administration. Mice will be placed in an open chamber and the total distance traveled and time spent in central quadrant will be recorded. Phase 3: Samples from the dose-response assessments will be analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify tissue drug and drug metabolite levels. This phase will consist of data analysis, where data will be expressed as the mean +/-SEM as percent relative effect compared to the reference agonist. The data collected from this experiment is intended to establish how the psychoactive and therapeutic profile of THCP compares to the related data for THC. This comparison can be used to establish intoxication equivalences, which will provide regulatory agencies with parameters to regulate the sale of products containing THCP and provide education and guidance regarding dosage and potency to consumers.","This project investigated the toxicity levels of THCP, a new cannabinoid thought to be more potent than THC. These researchers wished to uncover what this higher potency means for Cannabis recommendations and will be a critical first step in developing policies for Cannabis use. Their findings revealed no discernible difference in behavior between the two, potentially rewriting the rules of THCP's usage in therapy.","Cannabis, Animal Study, Gender Inclusive Science","THCP, Cannabinoid, THC, Mice",n/a,n,Cannabinoid Receptors,THCP,Policies for Cannabis Use,Animal,,Nutraceutical ,University of Saskatchewan,2023,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-andres-297796263,,,University of Oxford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pavel Powlowski,,Ruth Ross,Parsing the role of the endocannabinoid system in bipolar disorder: A genetic and patient-specific approach using inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to understand mitochondrial effects of cannabinoids in BD,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of enzymes and receptors which produce, degrade, and respond to the family of molecules known as endocannabinoids. The main chemical messengers of the system, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide, bind to cannabinoid type 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) receptors, where they play roles in memory, appetite, mood, sleep, immune function and more [1]. Drugs found in the Cannabis plant, like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), also act on the ECS to produce its various effects. \r\n \tIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the effects of cannabinoids on mitochondria. Mitochondria, often called the ‘powerhouse of the cell’, produce the energy (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) necessary for vital cellular functions. Mitochondria carry their own genome (mtDNA) separate from the rest of the cell, which differs between individuals. Mitochondrial function is particularly important in high-energy demand cells, such as neurons. In the brain, the ECS has been demonstrated to alter mitochondrial energy metabolism, resulting in changes to social interaction and memory in mice in-vivo. [2,3]  \r\n\r\n \tAs mitochondria are essential for basic cellular functions, it is no surprise that their impairment accompanies many diseases, including those of the brain where energy demand is high. Among them is bipolar disorder (BD), which presents in patients as manic, hypomanic, or depressive episodes, leading to difficulties in performing daily activities and maintaining relationships. While the disease etiology is complex, alterations to neuronal energy metabolism have been demonstrated. These include changes to the production of metabolites like lactate and phosphocreatine, lower levels of enzymes in the electron transport chain used by mitochondria to produce ATP, and changes to mitochondrial morphology in the brain [4]. While it is unclear whether mitochondrial dysfunction is a cause or symptom of BD, discovering ways to improve mitochondrial function remains an interesting proposition.\r\n\r\n \tFurthermore, a recent genome wide association study (GWAS) has implicated the endocannabinoid system as a gene system which is involved in bipolar disorder [5]. Bipolar disorder patients also display higher rates of cannabis use disorder than the general population. Taken together, there is reasonable evidence to propose that there is some sort of imbalance to the ECS which is present in bipolar disorder patients. \r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n \tTo investigate mitochondrial – endocannabinoid system interplay in the context of BD, we will employ two level approach: First, we will conduct genetic analysis on large populations of bipolar patients to guide our studies, then we will test the effects of modulating the ECS in inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from BD patients. \r\n \tWhole genome sequencing analysis from BD patient samples in the Andreazza lab has demonstrated that there are a number of mutations in the intronic regions of genes involved in synthesizing 2-AG, which are not found in age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric controls (n = 3 for each group). While this is evidently a small data set, given that the aforementioned GWAS study implicated endocannabinoid signaling in BD, attempting to modulate 2-AG signaling arises as an interesting possibility. \r\n \tAs BD is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with a large variety of genetic and environmental factors likely to impact symptom progression, large GWAS studies may miss important genetic influences related to subsets of BD patients. To help us understand the relevance of these endocannabinoid system perturbations, we will collaborate with the Mayo Clinic to perform candidate gene analysis in BD patients in a data set consisting of 500 BD patients with sequenced genomes, 200 of which have mtDNA sequences available. We will analyze the contribution of mutations in the endocannabinoid system toward all bipolar disorder samples together, as well as the contributions of ECS mutations toward specific subsets of BD (substance-use, metabolic syndrome phenotypes etc.). Risk scores will be calculated based on the interaction of mtDNA genotypes with ECS mutations. This will help us to understand if some subsets of BD are more likely to involve alterations to endocannabinoid signaling, or respond to ECS modulation, as well as if certain mitochondrial genetic backgrounds are particularly susceptible to ECS changes. \r\n \tThe Andreazza lab uses BD patient samples which have been converted to inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are cells that have been reprogrammed to a stem cell-like state. These cells can in turn be used to generate any cell type, which retain patient-specific genetic signatures. Using a sample set consisting of 5 bipolar disorder patients, 5 healthy controls, and 5 bipolar disorder patients with a family history of mitochondrial disease, I will generate cortical neurons to measure how their endocannabinoid system functions, in particular with regard to 2-AG signaling interplay with mitochondrial function. \r\n \tA number of different mitochondrial endpoints will be measured, including mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP and reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial energetic substrate utilization, oxygen consumption rates, as well as mitochondrial morphology. As calcium signaling is known to be a downstream effector of cannabinoid receptor activation, and the voltage-gated calcium channel 1.2 (CaV1.2) gene is commonly implicated BD, calcium influx into mitochondria and cytoplasmic fractions will be measured using calcium indicator dyes. To dissect the endocannabinoid system’s function, inhibitors of the 2-AG\/AEA production and degradation pathway will be used in these assays, resulting in increased or decreased levels of neurotransmitter activity. Finally, plant-based cannabinoids, THC and CBD, either alone or in combination, will be utilized to see if they improve or deteriorate mitochondrial function in BD.\r\n\tWe hypothesize that a subset of bipolar disorder patients will display altered signaling in the endocannabinoid system, particularly with regards to 2-AG. In patient samples with impaired mitochondrial function, we postulate that CBD may rescue some deficits, while patient samples with overactive mitochondria may benefit from treatment with THC. \r\n \t\r\n  \tThis study will have multiple important outcomes. Working to subdivide BD patients on the basis of their disease phenotype and ECS function, along with patient iPSC validation, will help the basic and clinical research communities tease out which patients may respond to cannabinoids, either in a helpful or deleterious manner. By understanding the basic biochemistry of BD and mitochondria in iPSC samples, we can also help map disease signatures, which can then be further targeted through other means of treatment in the future.","The endocannabinoid system, which responds to drugs like THC from Cannabis, plays many roles in regulating important bodily functions, such as mood, memory, sleep and others. This system is also able to alter the energy metabolism of cells, by impacting the ‘powerhouse of the cell’, the mitochondria. Many psychiatric disorders involve mitochondrial alterations and reduced cellular energy production, including bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder causes large mood fluctuations, resulting in manic and depressive episodes which impair daily life. This work aims to understand how mitochondrial function can be improved or degraded through cannabinoid drugs in the context of bipolar disorder.",,"Mitochondrial, Endocannabinoid, Function, Signaling, Energy",Bipolar Disorder,y,"Mood, Cellular Energy",Cannabis,"Map Disease Signitures, Treatment",Human,Basic,"Mind and Body, Personalized Treatment",University of Toronto,2023,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Pavel-Powlowski-2258644542,https://utcsp.utoronto.ca/,University of Toronto,,,,pavel.powlowski@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Haoyang Liu,,Shannon Dunn,Profiling of Immune Subsets with Ovarian Hormone Deprivation Associated Neuroinflammation in Human and Mice,"Background – Estrogen and progesterone, which are produced in high abundance by the ovaries, modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses.[1] Approximately 40% of women’s lives are spent in menopause, which is associated with a large drop in the production of ovarian hormones and this is associated with the development of systemic inflammation[2]. Menopause puts women at risk for the development of neuroinflammatory conditions such as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and accelerates neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS)[2, 3, 4]. Women who are at risk of developing ovarian cancer due to carriage of mutations in Breast Cancer Allele (BRCA) 1\/2 undergo Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO) (ovary removal) and this also leads to a rapid decline in estrogen[5]. Through a collaboration with Dr. Gillian Einstein at the University of Toronto, our lab has measured specific cytokines and chemokines in the serum of women with BSO and detected higher levels of C reactive protein, interleukin (IL-1)-β, IL-8, IL-6, IL-18, and MCP-1 relative to those in age-matched-matched control females (AMC-F) and women with BSO who were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy (BSO + E2).[6] Dr. Einstein has further observed that women with BSO experience also exhibit verbal memory deficits as compared to AMC-F and statistical analyses suggest that inflammatory cytokines are a mediator of these cognitive changes.[6]\r\nDespite the knowledge that BSO and menopause lead to the development of systemic inflammation[1], how inflammation develops at the single-cell level remains to be characterized. Studying the potential of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to make inflammatory cytokines and chemokines provides a window into what is occurring in the tissues in BSO since immune cells can be studied as they are travelling from lymphoid organs into inflamed tissue sites.[7] Mass cytometry, also known as Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) is an advanced method that uses metal-tagged antibodies to interrogate the expression of up to 40 cell-surface and intracellular protein antigens in PBMCs. These expressions are analyzed using unbiased, high-dimensional approaches[8] and inform on the activation state and inflammatory potential of individual immune cell types.[9] The first aim of my study is to utilize CyTOF technology to identify and characterize immune cell types that may be contributing to systemic inflammation in women with BSO. We hypothesize that both lymphocytes and monocytes of BSO women will have a higher potential to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to those of AMC or BSO+E2 participants.\r\nAlthough E2-containing hormone replacement therapy is available as a treatment option for women with BSO and menopause, the side effects outweigh the benefits in some individuals due to other safety concerns[10]. Hence, better treatment options must be explored to counteract the inflammation that develops with BSO and menopause to support healthy aging. In this regard, omega-3 fatty acids that are enriched in fatty fish, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties.[11]A clinical trial that tested the effects of EPA and DHA in women and men with systemic inflammation found these fatty acids to attenuate the release of TNFα and MCP-1 by monocytes.[11] For my second aim, we will be applying our single-cell technology expertise to interrogate PBMC samples collected from this trial (collaboration with Dr. Stefania Lamon-Fava, Tufts University) to better understand whether EPA or DHA counter the inflammatory pathways increased with menopause. We hypothesize that EPA and DHA treatment will inhibit the pro-inflammatory immune subsets increased with BSO and menopause. \r\nIn parallel, to advance our understanding of the cellular pathways that lead to the development of memory deficits and systemic inflammation, our lab has developed a murine model of BSO.  As in BSO women, adult BSO female mice exhibit significant impairment in a hippocampal-dependent spatial memory task and develop systemic inflammation compared to female sham-operated control mice. BSO mice also develop obesity, glucose intolerance and increased T cell activation and macrophage-associated cytokine production in the intestine and spleen. These changes with BSO are reversed by E2. Thus, my third aim is to characterize the inflammatory signatures in the mice with BSO and to test whether EPA and DHA, similar to E2, can reverse the effects of BSO on inflammation and memory. We hypothesize that EPA and DHA will limit BSO-induced inflammation and alleviate spatial memory deficits. \r\n\r\nMethods – PBMCs have been collected from the peripheral blood of 20-30 participants in the following groups: women with BSO, natural menopausal (NM) females (older than BSO, but also have dormant ovaries), AMC-females, AMC-males, and women that carry BRCA1\/2 mutations, but have intact ovaries (BRCA) (from Dr. Einstein’s cohort, collected under an approved REB) and from post-menopausal women treated or not with DHA and EPA by Dr. Lamon-Fava. PBMCs will be thawed and stimulated with various TLR ligands or PMA\/Ionomycin.[12] Surface staining with antibodies detecting lineage markers will be performed to define immune cell subsets.[13] Cells will be permeabilized and intracellular staining will be performed to detect cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-18, etc.). Cells will be analyzed with CyTOF to generate raw single-cell data. High dimensionality reduction analysis will be performed to map unique cell subsets present in the PBMCs of BSO women as compared to the other groups, with or without EPA\/DHA treatment. Similar studies will be performed in the BSO mouse model using a murine antibody panel. We will also evaluate whether DHA\/EPA can revert BSO-driven cognitive deficits in mice by feeding a diet enriched in EPA\/DHA starting at the time of BSO. These mice will be compared to sham-operated mice and BSO mice receiving control diet that is matched for protein, carbohydrates, and other nutrients. We will further evaluate the immune compartments of these mice before and after treatment. We will then investigate if certain immune subsets correlate with serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ovarian hormones, or the development of verbal memory deficits in women by correlating our findings with data collected by Dr. Gillian Einstein at the University of Toronto.","Menopause and Bilateral-Salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) result in a sudden loss in the production of hormones, estrogen and progesterone. This is associated with systemic inflammation that causes many health problems in women such as osteoporosis and memory deficits. Current hormone replacement therapy, while effective, has significant side effects including increased cancer risk. We aim to advance the fundamental understanding of how inflammation develops in females post-BSO by conducting experiments using human blood samples and mice. We will further evaluate the effect of providing dietary omega-3-fatty-acids  as treatments for this inflammation, with the goal of improving the lives of women after menopause.","Female Sex Horomones, Inflammation, Aging, Diet","Women, Inflammation, Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Menopause, Memory, Cytokines","""Bilateral-Salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), Menopause""",n,Inflammation,Omega-3-Fatty-Acids,"Nutrition, Quality of Life",Animal,,"Nutraceutical, Personalized Treatment",University of Toronto,2023,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00",Graduate,Graduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robert Moore,He/Him,"Tyler Cluff, Sean Dukelow",The On The Brain Podcast,"Knowledge translation is a cornerstone of science. A key aspect of knowledge translation is the communication of scientific ideas which can lead to the development of new theories, foster innovation, and play a role in policy decisions. Importantly, knowledge translation serves as an avenue through which research can directly impact the well-being of the general public. Thus, it is important that researchers and trainees actively engage with the public and enable them to voice their questions and concerns about research that will impact their day-to-day lives. Historically, one of the more common ways of engaging the public has been in-person communication (e.g. information and Q&A sessions, youth science camps and science fairs, school science programs, etc…). The COVID-19 pandemic has restricted many of these in-person events and has reduced opportunities for community outreach. This has changed the ways in which researchers and trainees engage with the public. Online forms of communication present as a pragmatic means of increasing engagement amongst researchers, trainees, and the general public. Communication technologies have seen tremendous advancements in the past few decades. This has prompted many researchers to re-imagine how science is communicated. The pandemic has accelerated this process, leading to a surge in online research content (e.g. online conferences, educational videos, and podcasts). The growing popularity of online content suggests that these new forms of communication may become increasingly important for knowledge translation in the future. Despite this, research training does not provide opportunities to develop the skills necessary for producing online content. Indeed, few educational videos and podcasts feature trainees and far less are produced by trainees. Thus, a program aimed at developing online science content that is run by trainees, for trainees, would not only provide a platform for individuals to share their research, but also an avenue to develop skills associated with producing online science content. The On the Brain podcast has recently begun production. Each episode features trainees from various disciplines of neuroscience and is produced by a team of trainees. This project will provide trainees the opportunity to plan and host episodes, work with audio and visual equipment, and use audio and video editing software to produce episodes. As of writing, the team has produced two pilot episodes and have additional episodes planned for the upcoming year. Given the strong presence of nutriceutical, neurotechnology, and precision medicine research at the University of Calgary, we plan to feature trainees from these research fields. The project will fill a gap in research training by providing an alternative means through which trainees can share their research with the public during and after the pandemic. Furthermore, trainees working on producing episodes develop a unique skillset that is rarely provided in most research training programs. Taken together, this project will help trainees refine their communication skills while preparing them to share their research across different online platforms throughout their careers. The ways in which scientific knowledge is translated is evolving; how we teach knowledge translation to aspiring scientists should also evolve.

Jane Porter,,Vivian Mushahwar,Translational Exercise Intervention Using Novel Technology for Innovative and Cost-effective Neurorecovery of Walking after Spinal Cord Injury,"This project aims to develop a novel, cost-effective, and widely translatable exercise therapy to reduce paralysis and improve walking capacity after an incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Improving the ability to walk improves quality of life after SCI and reduces secondary complications that impact both the affected person and their families as well as the health care system1.This project will specifically focus on reactivating neural networks throughout the spinal cord to produce maximal improvements in walking capacity2. When we walk, we swing our arms in rhythm with our legs due to neural connections in the spinal cord. This relationship between our arms and legs is needed to improve our balance and ability to walk efficiently3-5.Current rehabilitation interventions focus on restoring leg movements through intensive training on a treadmill or with a robotic device but do not systematically engage the arms in a coordinated fashion with the legs. Coordination of upper and lower limbs activates centers in the spinal cord that control locomotor movements that may improve walking function 3,6,7.lower limbs activates centers in the spinal cord that control locomotor movements that may improve walking function3,6,7. The lab of Dr. Mushahwar recently demonstrated, for the first time, that simultaneous arm and leg (A&L) cycling assisted with electrical stimulation doubles the improvements in over-ground walking for persons with iSCl compared to legs-only cycling and gait-specific training paradigms3. Furthermore, neuromodulation of spinal pathways using non-invasive spinal stimulation was shown to enhance descending activity from the brain and facilitate rehabilitation after SC18-12. The current project will focus on assessing the benefits in limb function after SCl using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) during electrical-stimulation-assisted A&L cycling to activate previously inaccessible neural circuits in the cord, improving interlimb connectivity, descending input and sensorimotor integration (i.e., neurorecovery). Therefore, the purpose of the proposed project is to determine, for the first time, whether long-term application of non-invasive spinal stimulation can improve over-ground walking when paired with A&L cycling for individuals with iSCl. It is hypothesized that the addition of spinal stimulation through tSCS will further improve the connectivity of neural networks between the brain and spinal cord, better improve connectivity of spinal cord networks, and better improve the recovery of walking than is currently possible with available rehabilitation practices. The investigation will specifically test whether the addition of SCS to electrical stimulation-assisted A&L cycling will further regulate spinal networks and restore functional abilities. Volunteers will undergo validated clinical, electronhvsioloaical and biomechanicalundergo validated clinical, electrophysiological, and biomechanical assessments prior to, during, and after A&L cycling with and without SCS to assess functional improvements produced by these two training paradigms. Three pre-training assessments will be used to establish a reliable baseline data set against which changes caused by the training paradigm can be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be improvements in over-ground walking speed using the 10-meter walking test. Secondary outcome measures will include:1) walking distance using the 6-minute walking test; 2) modulation of cervical-lumbar connectivity assessed electrophysiologically by investigating changes in H-reflex amplitude; 3) motor output and sensory perception using transcranial magnetic stimulation, muscle strength, and sensory assessment techniques; 4) walking metrics using motion capture and biomechanicalstrength, and sensory assessment techniques; 5) changes in the clinical level of injury through the international standardsfor neurological classification of spinal cord injury; and 6) cardiovascular function assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation. Training sessions will consist of 1 hour/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks. For study participants receiving SCS, stimulation will be applied to the skin over the spinal cord cervical and lumbar enlargements during the cycling activity. Over the course of the 4-month summer project, the goal will be to have 5 participants complete the study protocol. The study participants will have a chronic (> 1yr) iSCl at the C4 to T10 level with the injuries classified as AIS C or D. Upon completion of the project, it is expected that a comprehensive understanding of the effects of electrical stimulation-assisted A&L cycling training on spinal reflexes and interlimb connectivity will be attained. The effects of synchronized activation of the arms and legs with SCS on facilitating neural plasticity will also be established. If successful, this exciting training strategy can be directly translated to the clinic. Importantly, unlike currently available rehabilitation exercises for improving walking, our training strategy is not taxing on the therapists, which means that more people with SCl and other neurological conditions leading to mobility impairments can be treated without increasing healthcare system costs.","Coordination of upper and lower limbs activates centers in the spinal cord that control locomotor movements that may improve walking function.

Robin Green,,Benoit Mulsant,Filling a Gap: Evidenced-Based TeleNeuroRehab for Patients in Northern Ontario in the Chronic Stages of Acquired Brain Injury,"Context: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes a staggering toll, with an estimated 1-2% of the world’s population enduring lifelong disability at an estimated annual cost of $60 billion. We have studied the long-term consequences of moderate and severe TBI for several decades and have identified that unfortunately, in many patients, there are not only enduring consequences, but also progressive neural and cognitive declines in the chronic stages of injury1, 2. Encouragingly, we have identified post-injury, modifiable treatment targets to offset these declines – including elevated anxiety and insufficient cognitive stimulation 3, 4– both of which were associated with progressive hippocampal decline in our research. Based on these findings, and our demonstrations of the feasibility and efficacy of remotely delivered cognitive and mental health interventions 5-7, we launched the KITE TeleRehab Centre for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) in late 2017. The Centre enables us to translate our research findings into the care of patients in the chronic stages of TBI, and we have broadened our reach to patients suffering cognitive and mental health disorders secondary to any ABI and to patients with MS (who share clinical presentation and pathophysiology with moderate-severe TBI). Successes to date: At no costs to patients, we have treated over 536 patients, which represents nearly 11,000 patient visits (patients undergo intake assessments, one-to-one visits and complete one or more groups, each comprising 6-10 sessions). We have been disseminating Centre research findings, where we have examined feasibility of remote, group-based interventions; developed novel interventions; identified predictors of treatment response to enhance customization and generalizeability of treatments; and, studied response durability to ensure treatments are not only impactful, but remain so over time s8-11. Gap: While we have reached patients upwards of 1,400 km from our hospital (Thunder Bay), only a minority of our patients come from Northern Ontario, where there are the greatest gaps in care for patients - which telerehabilitation can address. Aim of this project: To reach more patients in areas of northern Ontario we have already reached (e.g., Thunderbay, Sault Ste. Marie) and to reach patients further north. Approach: (1) Identify regional ABI programs in northern Ontario through online searches, plus support from larger ABI organizations servicing northern Ontario: the March of Dimes, and the ABI System Navigators (clinicians across Ontario who provide global oversight for north Eastern, Central north and north western Ontario). (2) Share information with these programs about the KITE TeleNeuroRehab Centre via online presentations (comprising (i) a short video of our Centre [click here], (ii) a new presentation to be created for this purpose, (iii) a Q&A session). Impact and Deliverables: Over one year, we aim to identify at least 30 northern Ontario organizations to whom to deliver presentations. We aim to increase our referral of Northern Ontario patients over two years by at least 60 patients from Northern Ontario.",,,,,,,,,,,Mind and Body,University of Toronto,2024,5000,5000,,,,,,,"5,000.00","5,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin-Green-3,https://www.cognitiveneurorehablab.ca/,University of Toronto,,,,robin.green@uhn.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sukhman Chahal,She/Her,Chantel Debert,"Rapid, Accurate, and Cost-Effective (RACE) analysis of diagnostic and prognostic indicators of concussion; Effectiveness of concussion education resources in the emergency department.","Background\/Rationale: Annually, 450,000 Canadians are diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly termed a concussion and 80% of those diagnoses occur in emergency departments (ED) (Korley et al, 2016). Burden in the ED is increased as 10-20% of individuals return within 2 weeks (Morrison et al, 2019), and up to 30% will experience symptoms beyond 1 month post-injury, including headache, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue, known as persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) (Cancelliere et al, 2023). Prior research has shown that individuals who remembered receiving concussion education resources in the ED were less likely to report persistent symptoms (Ponsford et al, 2019). Therefore, providing proper education resources acutely after concussion may help to reduce return to ED and time to recovery.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\/Question: The primary objective of this project is the evaluate how concussion education resources can be utilized in acute concussion care. The first aim of this study is to evaluate whether individuals accessed concussion education resources when provided at the initial visit to the ED. The secondary aim is to determine the overall satisfaction and understanding of the concussion education resources. As an exploratory measure, we will examine whether accessing concussion education resources impact post-concussive symptom severity at two and six weeks post injury.\r\n\r\nProposed Methods: This project is a subset of a larger ongoing study: Rapid, Accurate and Cost-Effective (RACE) analysis of blood biomarkers for diagnosis of concussion. This study aims to recruit 150 adults (18-65 years old) with concussion (Silverberg et al, 2023), and 75 musculoskeletal injury control participants. Individuals will be recruited within seven days post-injury from the Foothills Medical Center ED. At the initial visit in the ED, participants will receive a QR code which will lead them to online concussion education resources. Concussion education resources include infographics, learning modules, and up-to-date evidence on concussion symptoms and recovery. Participants will also complete baseline questionnaires evaluating post-concussive symptom severity (PCSS) (Bunt et al, 2021), depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9]) (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001) and anxiety symptoms (generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7]) (Spitzer et al, 2006).\r\n\r\nParticipants will also complete follow-up assessments at two- and six-weeks post-injury. At the two week follow up participants will be asked if they accessed the provided concussion education resources and provide feedback regarding their overall satisfaction with the resources if they were accessed. In addition, participants will complete a brief quiz consisting of true or false questions to evaluate concussion knowledge regardless of if they accessed the education resources or not. Participants will repeat questionnaire measures at each follow up, including the PCSS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7.\r\n\r\nDescriptive statistics will be used to report whether individuals accessed concussion education resources. Overall satisfaction with the concussion education resources will be evaluated qualitatively to gain a better understanding of what individuals found helpful and how these resources can be improved for future use. To assess overall concussion knowledge, the follow-up quiz will be scored out of 15 and described using descriptive statistics. For the exploratory outcome, we will look at correlations between quiz score and scores on the symptom questionnaires at two- and six-weeks post-injury.\r\n\r\nPotential Implications: Providing concussion education resources in the acute stage post-injury has the potential to be a cost-effective, easily implemented intervention to empower patients to increase their knowledge of concussion. Educating patients on what to expect during concussion recovery may reduce return to ED and thus reduce ED burden. This study is the first step towards understanding the potential benefits of accessing education resources on individual concussion knowledge and recovery. Providing appropriate concussion education at the time of injury may reduce symptom burden at two-weeks post-injury and persistent symptoms at six weeks post-injury.","This project evaluates whether receiving concussion education benefits individuals post-injury. We will give participants education resources to help them learn about their injury. We hope to increase their understanding about what a concussion is and how to care for it. After two weeks, participants will be asked for feedback and quizzed on their concussion knowledge. We will assess if concussion awareness correlates to symptoms at two weeks post-injury. By encouraging participants to learn about their concussion, we aim to reduce their symptom burden and promote recovery.",,"Resources, Education, Injury",Concussion,n,Awareness,Education resources,Symptom Reduction,Human,,Personalized Treatment,University of Calgary,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kshef Kamran,,Chantel Debert,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as a Treatment of Chronic Neuropathic Pain in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury,"Introduction: \r\n\r\nIn Canada approximately 86,000 individuals1 sustain a spinal cord injury (SCI). Secondary complications that patients with a SCI may suffer from can include but are not limited to permanent paralysis, impaired sensory, and motor functions2. Neuropathic pain (NP) is a chronic pressured nerve pain that about 2\/33 of patients with a SCI experience. Injuries to the somatosensory system due to damage to subcortical pathways3 in patients with a SCI can lead to NP. Day-to-day tasks and activities can be heavily debilitated due to NP in patients after a SCI, and significantly reduce quality of life (QoL)3.\r\nPharmacotherapy is the first line of treatment for NP pain management; however, NP has shown to be a difficult neurological disorder to treat4. Pregabalin is a Health Canada approved pharmacological treatment for NP although group treated with pregabalin compared to a placebo were significantly more likely to report adverse events such as fatigue, dizziness, and ataxia5. Duloxetine6 is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) which is another Health Canada approved pharmacotherapy for managing NP but lower intellectual performance, and somnolence were observed. The goal of this study is to explore a potential non-pharmacological treatment to reduce NP and improve QoL by assisting the path of recovery for patients with a SCI. \r\nA promising non-invasive treatment for NP is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)6 which transmits a localized magnetic field to the underlying cortex of the brain. This neuromodulation treatment has been Health Canada approved for obsessive compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The rTMS treatment will be administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)7 which regulates cognitive and sensory activity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left DLPFC has shown improvements in depression, and experimental pain studies have demonstrated increased activation of this area during chronic pain. A case report8 has evaluated the efficacy of rTMS as a potential treatment for NP and have shown promise in reducing pain and improving QoL, however, the mechanism for the analgesic response remains unknown. \r\nThe gap in the literature can be determined through our primary outcome measure which is to evaluate the change in self-reported pain before and following rTMS treatment effect through the PROMIS Scale Neuropathic Pain Quality 5a questionnaire. Our secondary outcome measure is to assess patient symptomology following rTMS treatment through quality of life (QLI-SCI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), disability in adults (WHODAS), pain catastrophizing scale (PCS). We hypothesize that administering rTMS to the left DLPFC in patients with a SCI will reduce NP and have a beneficial effect on QoL.\r\n\r\nMethod: \r\n\r\nFrom Calgary inpatient and outpatient Physiatry clinics at the Foothills Medical Centre 10 patients from 18 and 80 years of age will be recruited for this feasibility case series. To be included in this case series patients must be diagnosed for NP through a physician-administered ASIA-International Standard for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ASIA-ISNDSCI) prior to participation. The patients enrolled in the study will receive 20-sessions Monday to Friday of high frequency rTMS, targeting the DLPFC for 4-weeks (10Hz, 10 trains of 60 pulses\/train with 45s inter-train intervals per session). The primary outcome measures will be analyzed by a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA). \r\n\r\nPotential Impact: \r\n\r\nAmong the individuals with a SCI about 2\/33 experience NP which can significantly impair their QoL. Pharmacotherapies such as gabapentinoid that are available for NP management have led to adverse events. Also, at times chronic pain in patients with a SCI has shown resistance3 to the effects of pharmacological treatments. As a result, many clinicians and patients are left seeking alternative management interventions for NP. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a potential intervention, and this non-invasive treatment has shown to be safe and feasible in this population8.\r\nThere are few pilot and small randomized control trials with focus on rTMS for patients with SCI in literature depicting improvement in both NP and quality of life. Although, the pain-relieving effect from rTMS treatment for NP requires further investigation. Our objective is to evaluate the patient’s symptomology and explore any prolonging analgesic effects following rTMS treatment on QoL up to 3-months post-intervention.","Approximately 86,000 Canadians experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Complications that follow can include sensory or motor function impairment. However, a common complication that about 2/3 of those with a SCI experience is neuropathic pain (NP). Currently, there are few evidence-based treatment options for NP though, a potential treatment is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repetitive TMS is a non-invasive, neuromodulation technique that transmits a magnetic field to the underlying cortex and it has shown to improve NP in patients with a SCI. We plan to investigate whether rTMS reduces NP following rTMS treatment in patients with a SCI.",,"SCI, Pain, sTMS",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Pain,TMS,Symptom Reduction,Human,,Tech,University of Calgary,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kshef-k-6911552b1/,,https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/lab/bnr/home,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alexandria (Lexi) Stein,,Clayton Dickson,The Effects of Cannabinoids on Brain Rhythms During Sleep,"Background\r\nSleep dysfunction is a major public health concern, as sleep disorders and insomnia are associated with an increased risk of developing a range of comorbid health issues, including hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, and obesity (1). Furthermore, poor sleep is linked to impaired cognitive performance and emotional regulation issues (2). Therefore, finding effective treatments is imperative. Even prior to its legalization in 2018, cannabis was used for specific medicinal therapies, including pain management, anti-emesis, epilepsy, and appetite stimulation, and now there is growing interest in using cannabis to manage sleep disorders (3). In fact, sleep dysfunction tends to be one of the most common reasons individuals report using medicinal marijuana (4). Existing literature has shown that delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBD), the most predominant cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, decrease sleep onset latency and increase total sleep duration (4,5). However, these cannabinoids may have an impact on the quality of the sleep they help facilitate, as cannabis is known for altering patterns of brain activity (5,6). This project aims to investigate how cannabis affects sleep quality by studying how the brain rhythms that occur during sleep and sleep-like states change in response to different cannabinoids, namely THC and CBD.\r\n\r\nThere are two main sleep states— Rapid-Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid-Eye Movement (NREM). Throughout a sleep epoch the brain alternates between these two states repeatedly. During each sleep state, local populations of neurons in specific brain regions have distinct rhythmic firing patterns called neural oscillations. This pattern of brain activity is observable by taking local field potential (LFP) recordings, an electrophysiological technique that measures the cumulative activity from a large group of cells using electrodes implanted within the brain, specifically positioned in the extracellular space. Both REM and NREM have characteristic neural oscillations; during REM, large amplitude theta waves with a 4-12 Hz frequency occur in the hippocampus (HPC), and during NREM large amplitude slow oscillations that occur at a 1 Hz frequency are present in the HPC and neocortex (nCTX). The theta and slow oscillations that occur during sleep have been implicated as critical for memory consolidation—the process by which short-term memories are solidified into long-term storage—especially hippocampal-dependent declarative memory (6,7). Specifically, the coherence and coordination between the oscillations occurring in the HPC and nCTX has been a suggested mechanism for this process (7). \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nFor this project, LFP recordings will be taken from the nCTX and HPC of rats anesthetized with urethane, which functions as a pharmacological model for sleep (9,10). A baseline of brain activity (which includes several alternations between REM and NREM and the neural oscillations that make up those states) will be recorded to serve as a within-subjects control. After the baseline, either THC, CBD, or both together will be administered intravenously. Then the post-infusion recording will be compared to the baseline. Frequency analysis techniques will be used to measure changes in the power and coherence of the theta and slow oscillations, as well as any changes in the proportion of REM and NREM. \r\n\r\nHypothesis\r\nWe expect to see a decrease in the power of theta, an increase in slow oscillations, and altered coherence between the HPC and nCTX oscillations (6).\r\n\r\nSignificance\r\nThe effects of cannabis on neural oscillations has thus far only been studied in awake subjects, and yet researching its effects on sleep is a critical piece in understanding the influence of cannabis on sleep quality (6). The advantage of this project is that we are able to look at this brain activity with far more specificity than is typically possible in human sleep models that utilize electroencephalography, as LFP recordings have better spatial resolution. It also allows us to look at two locations at once to observe dynamic interactions in the oscillations across the brain that are thought to underlie memory consolidation (7). If the general public is going to be using cannabis both recreationally and medicinally, it is imperative that they are informed about how it impacts sleep. Furthermore, differentiating the effects of THC vs CBD is important for understanding which cannabinoids are better suited for use as a sleep aid, and which may have deleterious side effects, particularly since some users may want the sleep benefits without the psychoactive features of THC.","This project looks at how cannabis affects sleep quality by studying how the brain activity that occurs naturally during sleep changes in response to different cannabinoids. There are two main stages in sleep, and during each stage there are different types of activity in different regions of the brain that are important for memory. We will record brain activity in rats during a sleep-like state and compare how it changes before and after giving THC or CBD. This will give us a better understanding of how cannabis impacts the brain during sleep, and its safety as a sleep aid.",,"Sleep, Oscillations, Brain, Cannabis, HPC","""Sleep Dysfunction, Sleep Disorders, Insomnia """,n,"Brain Rhythm, Hippocampus",Cannabis ,Sleep Quality,Animal,,Nutraceutical,University of Alberta,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,University of Alberta ,,,,astein@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cassia Culo,,Dave (David) Collins,"When using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to reduce paralysis, does stimulation frequency matter?","Background and Rationale\r\nA spinal cord injury (SCI) limits the ability to voluntarily control one’s muscles. The resulting lack of voluntary movement markedly reduces quality of life and can result in secondary complications to the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems. There is, however, exciting evidence that electrical stimulation applied through skin of the back over the spinal cord (transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation; tSCS) can restore voluntary control over muscles that were completely paralysed (Gerasimenko et al., 2015). After a SCI, some pathways between the brain and muscles remain intact, although these residual pathways may be too weak to activate muscles and produce movement. tSCS is thought to work by strengthening such pathways and re-engaging neural circuits that control movement. When applied over the lower back, tSCS remarkably improved voluntary leg movements for people with a complete SCI (Gerasimenko et al., 2015). After multiple sessions voluntary movements are further improved, even with the stimulation off (Inanici et al., 2021). Despite such promising results, these are early days for tSCS and there is no evidence for which to base decisions regarding how to apply tSCS for best results. For example, tSCS is delivered as a series of individual pulses, that, in different studies and laboratories are delivered at frequencies that range between 3-100 Hz (pulses per second), with no rationale for choice of pulse frequency. Accordingly, the goal of the proposed project is to begin to develop an evidence-base upon which frequency of tSCS to choose to reduce paralysis after a SCI. \r\n\r\nOverview of Methods and Rationale\r\nThe proposed experiments will be conducted in individuals with no history of neuromuscular injury or disease. tSCS will be applied for half an hour through the skin of the lower back to activate parts of the spinal cord that control the leg muscles. Outcomes will include measures of the “excitability” of pathways that control leg movements. The generally accepted idea is that the more tSCS increases the excitability of such pathways, the better tSCS will be to strengthen these pathways and restore movement after a SCI. In these experiments we test the idea that higher tSCS frequencies will increase the excitability of these pathways more than lower tSCS frequencies. The next step for this work is to conduct similar experiments in participants who have experienced a SCI and examine measures of excitability, contraction amplitude and voluntary function.\r\n \r\nDetailed Methods \r\nTwenty individuals with no history of neurological injury or disease between the ages of 18-65 will be recruited to participate. Each participant will take part in 4 (~2.5 hour) sessions, each separated by at least 2 days. In a given session, participants will either receive no tSCS (control) or tSCS for half an hour at 3, 30 or 100 Hz. The order of sessions will be randomised. Before, during and after the tSCS (or control period) measures will be made of a) the excitability of pathways that control movement and b) the size of contractions produced by electrical stimulation of leg muscles. To test the excitability of pathways from the brain to the muscle, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied over the brain (motor cortex) and responses (motor evoked potentials) will be recorded from leg muscles. To test the excitability of reflex pathways through the spinal cord, electrical stimulation will be applied over a nerve in the leg (tibial nerve) and responses (H-reflexes) will be recorded from leg muscles. The size of the evoked responses reflects the excitability of the neural circuits involved, with larger responses indicating greater excitability.\r\n\r\nHypotheses \r\n1. The excitability of pathways between the brain and muscle will be greater when tSCS is “on” than when tSCS is “off”. Thus, we predict that motor evoked potentials will be larger when tSCS is “on” than “off”\r\n2. The excitability of reflex pathways will be greater when tSCS is “on” than when tSCS is “off”. Thus, we predict that H-reflexes will be larger when tSCS is “on” than “off”\r\n3. The excitability of both pathways will increase as tSCS frequency increases. Thus, we predict that motor evoked potentials and H-reflexes will be larger when tSCS frequency is higher. \r\n\r\nPotential impact\r\nIf the hypotheses are supported, it will show that tSCS increases the excitability of neural pathways that control movement in a frequency dependent manner, with higher frequencies increasing the excitability of these pathways more than lower frequencies. This suggests that to reduce paralysis after a SCI, higher frequency tSCS may act like a larger amplifier and boost weak voluntary signals more than lower frequency tSCS. The next step for this work is to test these ideas in individuals who have experienced a SCI.","A spinal cord injury limits the ability to produce muscular contractions (and therefore movement) and thus can both reduce quality of life and lead to secondary complications. Our project will investigate a technique that stimulates the spinal cord through the skin of the back to restore voluntary movement for people with a spinal cord injury. It is as though the stimulation works like an amplifier and “boosts” voluntary contractions, like flipping a switch! Our results will help to inform future decisions about how to apply the spinal stimulation to best reduce paralysis for people with a spinal cord injury.",,"tscs, Pathways, Excitability, Control, Muscles",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Voluntary Movement,tSCS,Treatment,Human,,Tech,University of Alberta,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassia-culo-a54618303/,,,University of Alberta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terry Clark,,Evan Cortens,3rd Annual Arts Care Conference,"Arts Care refers to the role of the passive and active arts (music, drama, painting, etc.) engagement in supporting people's development, health, and wellbeing. For example, using the arts to support rehabilitation post-stroke, singing to improve voice function for people with Parkinson's disease, and using music for emotional and thought regulation with autism. Internationally, practitioners and researchers arise from a wide range of disciplines like music, painting, medical humanities, medicine, music in health, art and music therapy. The Arts Care Conference seeks to advance Arts Care research and practice through knowledge transfer that contributes to greater uptake among professionals and community users. In Calgary, there is growing interest in leveraging the arts as interventions that have profound impact upon health and well-being, specifically for those struggling with neurological impairing conditions and challenges. Despite the interest in this particular field, there is a lack of opportunity for knowledge transfer and networking. A further barrier to impactful update and engagement with Arts Care is a lack of professional development opportunities for practitioners. Therefore, there is an opportunity and need to convene interested therapists, performing artists, medical professionals, researchers, and community organizations to explore the diverse needs and opportunities with using arts-based interventions as a therapeutic non-medical intervention. The Conference has grown substantially from previous iterations with interest being expressed throughout the year. The interdisciplinary gathering will include delegates from Mount Royal Conservatory, Mount Royal University, Alberta Health Services, and the Universities of Alberta, Calgary, and Lethbridge. Invitations will also be spread widely across Calgary and the province to artists and musicians, clinical, service user, and academic communities. The goals of the participatory conference are: Elucidate the research, methods, and applications of Arts as non-medical intervention. Identify areas of shared interest, work, and research among attendees Promote future projects, applications, research, and funding bids. Provide an opportunity for networking and sector collaboration. Desired outcomes are: Develop a shared understanding of current opportunities and challenges of arts-based interventions. Grow our community of collaborators and provide an opportunity for knowledge sharing and collaborative work for service users. Build and expand our list of novel music and arts initiatives that support the application for individuals with neurological challenges and support health and wellbeing. For attendees to walk away knowing at least one more person in this field. Grow the Calgary-based arts care network. By bringing together professional, amateur, and student performing artists and other Calgary-based organizations, researchers and clinicians, and diverse service user groups, the conference aims to provide an interdisciplinary forum that will substantively contribute to the development and implementation of novel arts-based interventions health like Concerts in Care. These Concerts position Conservatory musicians at Calgary’s South Health Campus in partnership with AHS and Stagehand, bringing music to hospital settings including neuro-rehab.

Michael Cheng,,Hsiang-Yuan Lin,Comparing Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Sites For Autism Through Neural Variability,"Rationale:\r\n\r\nAutism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by the core traits of social difficulties and repetitive behaviours\/focused interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Options for managing these core autistic traits are limited at the moment, with no pharmacological interventions being approved in Canada and applied behaviour analysis facing criticism from autism rights activists (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2016; Leaf et al., 2022). Given this dearth of available treatments, a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol suitable for autism could potentially serve as a useful tool to support the mental health of autistic individuals. Identifying an optimal stimulation site is a crucial hurdle in designing such an rTMS protocol that must be overcome.\r\n\r\nAlterations in the neural circuitry underlying biological motion perception (BMP), the ability to identify human movement and infer socially salient information, may play an important role in the manifestation of core autistic traits (Todorova et al., 2019). A previous study from our lab (manuscript in preparation) aimed to characterize how inter-individual differences in brain areas recruited for BMP may relate to autistic cognitive and behavioural traits. We found that more idiosyncratic patterns of BMP-evoked brain activity significantly correlated with greater social difficulties (as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale) and a greater degree of repetitive behaviours (as measured by the Repetitive Behaviors Scale - Revised) transdiagnostically across neurotypical and autistic participants. Although the current evidence for this relationship is correlational, methods to decrease an individual’s degree of idiosyncrasy in BMP-evoked neural activity could have potential therapeutic value in controlling social difficulties and repetitive behaviours.\r\n\r\nStimulating the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) may be particularly effective for modulating BMP-evoked neural activity given that it preferentially responds to biological motion compared to general visual stimuli and is believed to play an important role in BMP (Grossman & Blake, 2001). This study aims to compare rTMS of the pSTS in autistic individuals to stimulation of areas not unrelated to BMP in order to identify an optimal stimulation site for managing social difficulties and repetitive behaviours and to ascertain whether any rTMS-mediated improvements are mediated modulation of BMP-evoked neural idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nThree clinical trials have already been conducted on rTMS applied in autistic individuals over the pSTS (Ni et al., 2021), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Ni et al., 2023), and right inferior frontal gyrus (manuscript awaiting publication). Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Repetitive Behaviors Scale - Revised (RBS-R) scores, task functional data (fMRI) acquired while patients watched videos of biological motion, and resting-state fMRI data were collected before and after stimulation was applied. In order to determine which stimulation site results in the greatest impact on core autistic traits: paired t-tests will be used to compare the expression of core autistic traits (SRS and RBS-R) prior to and following stimulation with age, sex, and mean framewise displacement (a measure of head motion in the MRI machine) included as covariates. Individuals’ level of BM-evoked and resting state neural idiosyncrasy will be quantified as their mean correlational distance compared to all other participants in their trial as outlined by Hawco et al. (Hawco et al., 2020). The effect of stimulation of each brain site on these idiosyncrasy metrics can also be assessed using paired-t tests with age, sex, and mean framewise displacement as covariates. In order to assess whether changes in core autistic traits are related to changes in neural idiosyncrasy, linear (Pearson’s) and nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlations between changes in SRS\/RBS-R and changes in neural idiosyncrasy statistics will be assessed across all participants from all three clinical trials.\r\n\r\nHypotheses:\r\n\r\nThis study aims to answer both foundational mechanistic questions about whether rTMS acts on the autistic brain by modulating neural variability and clinical questions about which rTMS stimulation site can most optimally modulate core autistic traits. Given that the pSTS has a specific role in BMP, rTMS of the pSTS is likely to have a greater effect on BMP-evoked neural idiosyncrasy than rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or right inferior frontal gyrus (riFG). Because we previously discovered a correlation between BM-evoked neural idiosyncrasy was previously and SRS\/RBS-R and because pSTS stimulation is likely to have the greatest impact on said idiosyncrasy, pSTS stimulation is also likely to be more effective than dlPFC or riFG stimulation at managing core autistic traits.\r\n\r\nPotential Impact:\r\n\r\nAn optimized rTMS protocol for addressing social difficulties and repetitive behaviours would be the first biomedical tool available to Canadian physicians to manage core autistic traits. Such a tool could open new avenues for autistic mental health support.","Psychiatrists have limited options for managing the core traits of autism: social difficulties and repetitive behaviours/focused interests. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising technology used to artificially stimulate specific brain regions. Brain regions used to understand body language seem to affect core autistic traits; a previous study suggests that people who expressed these traits more strongly tended to use different brain areas to process body language than their peers. By stimulating the pSTS, an area crucial to body language processing, we may be able to manage core autistic traits by modulating the brainʼs response to body language.",,"Autistic, Stimulation, Neural, rTMS, Idiosyncrasy",Autism Spectrum Disorder,y,Perception,TMS,"Symptom Management, Body-Language Recognition",Human,,Tech,University of Toronto,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-cheng-b05874251/?originalSubdomain=ca,,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alessia Apa,,Isabelle Aubert,Unveiling the Potential: Focused Ultrasound-Induced Oligodendrogenesis as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease,"Background: Oligodendrocytes, prevalent in the brain's white matter, play a crucial role in maintaining axonal integrity. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter abnormalities are observed alongside the well-known accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Moreover, oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin alterations are recognized as early contributors to AD progression1,2. Autopsy samples from individuals with AD show reduced myelin density in specific brain regions, emphasizing the significance of oligodendrocytes in the disease3,4. RNA-sequencing studies reveal cell-type-specific changes related to myelination in early AD stages5,6. Recognizing the importance of oligodendrocytes, our goal is to develop therapeutic interventions supporting oligodendrocytes and myelination to slow disease advancement.\r\n\r\nRationale: Preliminary data from Dr. Isabelle Aubert's laboratory indicates that focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubble injection increases oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and oligodendrogenesis. This effect, unique to our research group, presents a novel avenue for potential AD treatment. The mechanisms behind FUS-induced oligodendrogenesis remain unclear, but modulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may activate the injury response of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ). SVZ-derived OPC migration is observed in conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and in animals models of demyelination and stroke7-9. This proposal addresses knowledge gaps related to FUS-induced oligodendrogenesis by examining the contribution of SVZ-derived OPCs to FUS-mediated oligodendrogenesis. \r\n\r\nMethods: Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a non-invasive technique utilizing MRI guidance to target specific brain regions without damaging tissue. When combined with intravenously administered microbubbles, FUS can modulate the BBB temporarily10. Previous research from our team demonstrated that FUS-BBB modulation, even without therapeutic administration, has positive effects in amyloidosis mouse models, reducing pathology and promoting various neuroprotective responses11-15.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the presence of SVZ-derived OPCs at the site of FUS-BBB modulation, we will utilize a method of in vivo pulse labelling termed FlashTag. This method involves the intraventricular injection of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE), which fluoresces only after it is taken up by cells16. This technique takes advantage of the fact that SVZ progenitors (i.e. Type B1 cells), which give rise to OPCs, make direct contact with the ventricle by extending a thin cellular process between ependymal cells. FlashTag enables the visualization of cells that migrate long distances from their place of birth, thereby making this technique particularly well-suited to the tracing of SVZ-derived OPCs to the site of FUS-induced BBB permeability.\r\n\r\nHypothesis: Our hypothesis posits that the combined use of FUS and microbubble-induced BBB modulation prompts the migration of SVZ-derived OPCs to the FUS-modulated site in the adult mouse brain, thereby contributing to FUS-mediated oligodendrogenesis and offering a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.\r\n\r\nSpecific Aims: The hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims in adult C57BL\/6J mice.\r\nAim 1: Optimize the in vivo labelling of Type B1 progenitors in the adult mouse SVZ using FlashTag – We will first conduct a dosing experiment to determine the optimal volume of FlashTag required to label progenitors in the SVZ of adult mice. Groups of adult mice will receive intraventricular injection of 0.5 uL or 1.0 uL FlashTag to the lateral ventricle. Mice will be sacrificed at 24 hours or 4 days post-injection – timepoints that correspond to the proliferative window of OPCs post-FUS (preliminary data). Using standard immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques, I will confirm the cellular identity of FlashTag-labelled cells as Type B1 progenitors using antibodies against Nestin, SOX2 and GFAP. \r\n\r\nAim 2: Evaluate contribution of SVZ-derived OPCs to FUS-mediated striatal oligodendrogenesis – 24 hours prior to FUS treatment, mice will receive bilateral intraventricular injection of FlashTag to the lateral ventricle to label SVZ progenitors. FUS will be targeted unilaterally to the striatum, with the contralateral striatum serving as an internal control. Groups of mice (n=4 per group) will be scarified at 24 hours or 4 days post-injection. Brains will be extracted and using standard IHC techniques, I will evaluate the presence of FlashTag-labelled, SVZ-derived cells at the site of FUS-BBB modulation. I will evaluate the colocalization of FlashTag labelled cells with antibodies against markers of OPCs (i.e. PDGFRa, OLIG2, NG2), to identify SVZ-derived OPCs at the site of FUS application.\r\n\r\nSignificance: Enhancing oligodendrogenesis is a promising therapeutic avenue for diseases like AD with demyelination. Currently, no approved therapies target oligodendrocyte lineage cells. FUS, a non-invasive strategy, has shown potential in expanding OPC populations and promoting oligodendrogenesis. Our research, unique in the scientific community, aims to fill this knowledge gap and establish FUS as a multimodal therapy for complex AD brain pathologies by supporting white matter cells.","This proposal investigates the potential of focused ultrasound (FUS) technology as a novel and non-invasive strategy for enhancing the population of oligodendrocytes, the support cells found in white matter. Preliminary data suggests FUS enhances the birth and maturation of new oligodendrocyte cells, offering a unique approach to address white matter abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerʼs disease. Using advanced techniques like FlashTag, we aim to improve in vivo labeling and tracking of oligodendrocyte precursor cells at FUS target sites. This study holds unexplored promise for developing a non-invasive therapeutic strategy targeting oligodendrocytes in white matter disease.",,"FUS, SVZ, OPCS, Flashtag, Cells, Oligodendrogenesis",Alzheimer's Disease,n,Oligodendrocyte Cells,FUS-BBB modulation,Treatment,Animal,Translational,Tech,University of Toronto,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessia-apa-8575182a5/,,,University of Waterloo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Si Chen Pan,,Jillian Miller,The association between brain structural connectivity and placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia responses in youth.,"Rationale: Pediatric chronic pain, which is pain that persists for 3 or more months, is a rising health concern affecting approximately 1 in 4 youth (King et al., 2011). Unmanaged chronic pain in youth can persist into adulthood and is often associated with significant pain-related disability (Harrison et al., 2019). Current treatments for pain are limited by low response rates, risk of side-effects, and overuse of pharmaceuticals (Guite et al., 2018). Placebo, inert treatment, shows promise in dramatically improving the efficacy of pain therapy (Kaptchuk & Miller, 2015).\r\n\r\nPlacebo remains the only intervention that is effective for all pain types and has a large effect size (Colloca, 2018). Thus, harnessing placebo, and\/or reducing nocebo (negative expectations of a treatment) effects has significant implications for medical practice. Several adult studies have used brain imaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to identify the neurobiological mechanisms involved in placebo and nocebo effects. \r\nDTI is a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging technique used to investigate the microstructure of white matter in the central nervous system. Using DTI, we can extract various indices: fractional anisotropy (FA), looking at axonal connectivity and fiber organization; mean diffusivity (MD), indicating magnitude of diffusion; axial diffusivity (AD), measuring fiber density and axon characteristics; radial diffusivity (RD), measuring myelination (Le Bihan et al., 2001). Studies suggest that there is a positive correlation between placebo analgesia response and FA in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left rostral anterior cingulate cortex in adults (Stein et al., 2012). However, these results cannot be confidently applied to adolescent patients due to the immaturity of their cortex (Konrad, Firk, & Uhlhaas, 2013). \r\n\r\nStudies on pediatric chronic migraine patients suggest abnormalities in white matter tracts including increased fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreased mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity is various areas of the brain, including the brainstem, thalamus, and cingulum (Messina et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2021). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between brain structural connectivity and placebo\/nocebo response in youth. This project aims to examine the white matter microstructure of adolescent brains in relation to placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. \r\n\r\nHypothesis: Youth will have increased FA, and decreased MD, AD, and RD with greater efficacy of placebo and nocebo treatments. \r\nMethods: The projected study will use functional neuroimaging to characterize the neurobiology of placebo and nocebo effects in the developing brains of adolescents. 80 healthy youth between the ages of 14-18 years will undergo 3T MRI scanning and pain testing at the Alberta Children’s Hospital (ACH). First, participants’ thresholds for low, moderate, and high heat pain will be established by applying heat to the right arm via a metal probe. Then, a 3x3 grid will be drawn on their forearm. One inert cream will be dyed three different colours (pink for capsaicin, blue for lidocaine, yellow for neutral). One colour will be applied to each row of the grid. Participants will be made to believe that the pink cream induces hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity), the blue cream induces analgesia (decreased sensitivity), and the yellow cream has no effect. Heat pain will then be applied to the grid to manipulate patient perception of placebo and nocebo effects using their established pain thresholds. Pain intensity will be recorded via self-reports using a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 “no pain” to 10 “worst pain imaginable”. Subsequently, MRI scans will be performed. Mean FA, MD, AD, and RD will be obtained from diffusion tensor images (DTI). Standard preprocessing of DTI data will be conducted using Freesurfer 5.3, and ExploreDTI. Correlations between DTI parameters and pain intensity ratings will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26.0. \r\n\r\nImpact: The annual cost of pain is greater than the annual costs of heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined (Gaskin & Richard, 2012). Approximately, 2 out of 3 youth with chronic pain will become adults with chronic pain (Walker, Sherman, Bruehl, Garber, & Smith, 2012). Therefore, it is imperative that we manage pain during adolescence to prevent lifelong suffering and hardship of the individual and their families. Utilizing placebo as a treatment represents a promising new avenue for managing chronic pain. However, it’s efficacy may vary based on the maturation of the developing brain. This research will help to identify for whom placebo analgesia is most effective, and who is most susceptible to nocebo hyperalgesia. This research will help us to optimize and individually target our pain treatments to those who will benefit the most from this non-invasive form of treatment.","Pain lasting longer than three months in youth is very difficult to treat. Placebo, a substance with no active ingredients that resembles medication, has been the only intervention that has proven to be effective for all pain types. However, most placebo studies have been conducted in adults. Our project proposes to see whether greater brain connectivity is related to better placebo responses in youth. This work will help us to identify who is most responsive to placebo effects. This will allow us to target placebo pain management strategies to the youth who will benefit from this treatment.",,"Pain, Placebo, Diet, DTI, Youth",Chronic Pain,y,"Pain, Brain Connectivity",Analgesic (pain) Cream,"Placebo effects, Youth",Human,"Basic, Translational",Mind and Body,University of Calgary,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Si-Chen-Pan-2256403678,https://www.painslab.ca/,University of Calgary,,,,si.chenpan@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joel Burma,,Jonathan Smirl,"Using a Multimodal Imaging Protocol to Understand The Influence of Biological Sex, Menstrual Cycle Phase, and Sex Hormones on Cerebrovasular regulation","Background: The brain is one of the highest-perfused organs within the body as it consumes ~20% of resting oxygen levels (1). However, as the brain has minimal nutrient storage, it is heavily dependent upon maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) (1). During metabolically demanding tasks, an augmented oxygen supply is required by the active cortical regions to ensure normal functioning. This parallel response of matching blood supply with neuronal requirements is known as neurovascular coupling (NVC) (2). The current project is seeking to employ a novel multimodal and non-invasive neuroimaging approach to better understand the intricacies of this response in humans. Historically, neuroimaging modalities have been used unaccompanied to index the NVC response. These include transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) (3), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), among others. The former quantifies the velocity of red blood cells moving through deep, larger conduit vessels (i.e., middle/posterior cerebral arteries) (3), while the latter assesses changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated hemoglobin within the superficial microvasculature (4). It is widely hypothesized that the NVC response is initiated based on neuronal activity, which signals the endothelium to dilate and divert more blood to the active cortices (5). Hence, TCD and fNIRS are only capable of providing an indirect assessment of neuronal firing through the hemodynamic changes. Combining fNIRS and TCD with a technology that measures cortical activity [i.e., electroencephalography (EEG)], would enable researchers to provide a direct link between neuronal activation and local vascular changes. Further, the NVC response is thought to be comprised of feedforward and feedback hypotheses. The feedforward hypothesis theorizes neuronal activity results in local dilation/oxygen changes, which will divert upstream delivery to these working regions (2). The feedback hypothesis states metabolic by-products produced from the increased brain metabolism would result in local vasodilation (2). Both of these hypotheses would be quantifiable with a combination of EEG, fNIRS, and TCD. Finally, the majority of NVC studies have been conducted in smaller samples of healthy male participants, where females were excluded due to the unknown influence the menstrual cycle has on the compliancy of the cerebrovasculature. This ultimately limits the clinical utility of previous findings (6-8); however, exploration into the confounding factors used to exclude females will promote greater representation in future cerebrovascular-based research. The overall purpose of this proposal is to create a novel multimodal EEG-fNIRS TCD imaging protocol that is capable of comprehensively assessing the relationship between neuronal function and hemodynamic changes. This will then be used to better understand confounding factors, future research investigations need to consider when developing their methodological designs. Objective 1: Provide a real-time concurrent assessment of the feedforward and feedback loops of the NVC response, with a multimodal imaging approach capable of quantifying cerebral electrical activity, local microvasculature oxygenation, and deep cerebral blood velocity. Objective 2: Elucidate the extent NVC is confounded by biological sex, cardiorespiratory fitness, history of concussion, age across adulthood, menstrual cycle phase, and ovarian hormones. Methods: A total of 60 healthy/uninjured individuals (45 females and 15 males; 18-40 years) will be recruited to participate across three testing sessions. Females will be grouped into categories of hormonal intrauterine device users (N=15), oral contraceptive pill users (N=15), and eumenorrheic females (N=15). Females will track the average length of their menstrual cycle and the day of ovulation using provided luteinizing hormone urine strips (16). This will allow the researchers to individualize data collection according to each participantʼs unique menstrual cycle, and standardize testing days for the follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases between participants (16). Males and hormonal contraceptive users will be tested at three equivalently spaced time points (i.e., ~7-10 days). Testing will commence at 0800 with an antecubital blood draw to determine plasma and serum quantifications of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol. Following, participants will be instrumented with EEG, fNIRS, TCD, and other non-invasive equipment to control for blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing patterns. The NVC response will be quantified during resting-state, visual-based (Whereʼs Waldo?) (9-13), and motor-based (Finger-tapping) paradigms (14). Peak absolute changes in hemodynamics and total activation will characterize the NVC response. Linear mixed models with the inclusion of biological sex, sex hormone concentrations, menstrual cycle phase, and contraceptive methods will identify differences for all outcome measures of interest. Significance: This project will be the first to concurrently employ three neuroimaging devices (TCD, fNIRS, and EEG) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the NVC response. Further, physiological-based studies have largely cited the menstrual cycle as justification to exclude female participants. However, excluding half the population in basic science studies drastically reduces the transferability to clinical applications. Quantifying the extent the menstrual cycle influences cerebrovascular regulation will help inform if future studies are capable of testing female participants at any time point in their menstrual cycle. This will ensure equal sex representation is achieved, enabling greater generalizability of cerebrovascular-based research."," This project aims to advance our understanding of how the brain matches its blood supply to meet its energy needs. By using a novel combination of three non-invasive neuroimaging technologies the research seeks to directly observe how brain activity affects blood flow. Additionally, it will investigate how factors like biological sex, fitness level, concussion history, age, menstrual cycle, and hormones may influence brain function. This approach is pioneering in its comprehensive assessment and inclusion of females, addressing a significant gap in previous research that often excluded them due to menstrual cycle variability.",,"ncv, Response, Cycle, Menstrual, fnirs",n/a,n,Blood flow,"Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), EEG",Assessment,Human,,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Calgary,2024,"50,000.00","25,000.00",,,,,,,"25,000.00","50,000.00",SPG,SPG,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=LmZI0skAAAAJ ,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joel-Burma ,,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amsal Rajan,,Kara Murias,Targeting Deficits in Children With ADHD: Exploring the Impact of TMS Location on Executive and Motor Functioning,"Rationale: Attention Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 5% of children in Canada [1]. Many children with ADHD present with deficits in executive functions (EF: cognitive skills allowing for goal-directed behaviour) [2]. Examples of EF include attention switching or flexibility (switching between tasks, demands, or perspectives) and cognitive inhibition, also known as interference control (preventing intrusion by irrelevant stimuli) [3]. Children with ADHD can also present with difficulties in fine motor control [4]. Combined with EF deficits in ADHD, these dysfunctions can make classroom learning especially difficult [4]. Furthermore, not every child will present the same EF and motor deficits [5].\r\nADHD can lead to negative long-term outcomes when impairments are addressed incorrectly, including increased rates of depression, accidents, incarceration, and suicide [6]. The risk for poor outcomes can be decreased with effective treatment [6]. However, ADHD in children is usually treated with long-acting stimulant medications that are not always effective, potentially bringing intolerable side effects like sleep disturbances and emotional lability [7]. A promising treatment alternative with minimal side effects is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has been proven to be safe in children [8,9]. TMS is currently approved for treating other neuropsychiatric conditions in adults (i.e. Major Depressive Disorder) [10].\r\n\r\nTMS works by applying a coil with a changing magnetic field to the scalp to stimulate specific brain regions. If applied repeatedly, TMS can lead to alterations in the activation patterns of neural populations [3]. Studies show that a single session of repetitive TMS (rTMS) can lead to transient improvements in cognitive functions, whereas multiple sessions over time can lead to long-term changes and can be used for treatment [11,12]. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a form of rTMS shown to be effective in treatment in a short period [8].\r\n\r\nTo advance the use of TMS in the treatment of ADHD in children, we must first identify cortical targets for treatment. There is no one specific brain area associated with impairment in all individuals with ADHD. However, there are specific brain regions related to specific EF and motor deficits seen in children with ADHD [12,13]. Two cortical areas that have been most associated with specific measures of EF and motor skills in ADHD, as well as correlated with symptoms, are the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC; associated with cognitive inhibition\/interference control) and the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG; associated with attention switching\/sustained attention and has implications in motor control) [14-17]. Since children with ADHD can have different presentations of EF and motor deficits, we can personalize treatment by targeting different areas responsible for specific deficits using TMS.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the change in EF and motor skills in children with ADHD when iTBS is applied to the rDLPFC or rSFG. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive active iTBS to the rSFG or the rDLPFC, or sham (placebo) iTBS to the rSFG. Active iTBS delivers magnetic pulses to stimulate brain areas, whereas sham iTBS uses a different coil that produces the same sound as active iTBS but does not deliver magnetic pulses. EF and motor skills will be tested before and after the iTBS session using the dimension change card sorting (DCCS) task (measures attention switching), flanker task (measures cognitive inhibition), and the Purdue pegboard task (PPT; measures fine motor skills). The scores from these tasks pre-stimulation to post-stimulation will be compared across the groups (active rSFG\/rDLPFC and sham rSFG).\r\n\r\nAim 1: Changes in EF skills from before and after a single session of iTBS in children with ADHD will be assessed. The scores from the active rSFG and rDLPFC, and sham groups will be compared to each other.\r\nHypothesis 1a: Active iTBS applied to the rSFG will result in the greatest increase in performance on the DCCS task compared to the active rDLPFC or sham rSFG groups.\r\nHypothesis 1b: Active iTBS applied to the rDLPFC will result in the greatest increase in performance on the flanker task compared to the active rSFG or sham rSFG groups.\r\n\r\nAim 2: Changes in motor skills from before and after a single session of iTBS in children with ADHD will be assessed. The scores from the active rSFG rDLPFC, and sham groups will then be compared to each other. \r\nHypothesis 2: Active iTBS applied to the rSFG will result in the greatest improvement on the PPT compared to the active rDLPFC or sham rSFG groups.\r\n\r\nMethods: 60 children with ADHD (no other neurological disorder) aged 10-16 will be recruited for participation in this study. Participants must be receiving treatment of a single stimulant medication for the past 3 months at a consistent type and dose (no other psychoactive medications) with refractory symptoms. Participants will be randomized into three groups to receive active iTBS to the rSFG or rDLPFC, or sham iTBS to the rSFG, with 20 participants in each group. Active and sham iTBS will be used to assess the effectiveness of delivering actual stimulation. EF and motor skills will be tested with the flanker task, DCCS task, and PPT. These assessments will be performed before and after a single session of iTBS in a randomized order. The change in scores from the assessments following iTBS will be compared across all groups.\r\n\r\nImpact: Comparing performance on tasks of specific EF and motor skills between stimulating the rDLPFC and rSFG can help us better understand their functioning and identify targets for treatment. As the first study investigating the effects of using iTBS in children with ADHD, we can advance the use of neurostimulation in these children, as well as help guide the development of personalized therapies based on individual differences in EF and motor deficits. This is important as there is no one-size-fits-all treatment for ADHD; it is imperative that every individual receives treatment unique to their impairments. If we can address specific deficits with TMS, this research could be extended to other populations with EF and motor deficits such as Autism Spectrum Disorder.","Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural disorder affecting around 5% of children in Canada. These children often have varying difficulties with functions that help us plan and control behaviour and are associated with different brain areas. ADHD is usually treated with medications, but they arenʼt always effective and can cause intolerable side effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form of brain stimulation that can target specific brain areas responsible for specific difficulties.

Martin Bardhi,,Keith Sharkey,Treating Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) from the Gut,"Background and preliminary work: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurological disease caused by the degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in progressive weakness of all voluntary muscles, and premature death. ALS occurs more frequently and severely in males than in females, for unknown reasons. The Sharkey and Nguyen labs have shown that the sexually dimorphic phenotype of ALS is recapitulated in a mouse model of ALS with a mutation in the gene encoding for TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP43, TDP43-A315T). Nearly all human ALS cases show abnormal accumulation of TDP43 in the cytosol, making this a universal pathological signature of the disease. This is the only model that displays these characteristics making it an excellent model to use for our studies. \r\n\r\nThe bacteria that live in the gastrointestinal tract that normally contribute to health are altered in patients with ALS. Using the mutant TDP43 model of ALS, the Sharkey and Nguyen labs have recently found similar findings and specifically, that there are reduced numbers of bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in both male and female mice. Amongst other functions, SCFAs regulate gut barrier function, inflammation and the immune system of the brain and therefore, their reduction may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. This discovery offers us the opportunity to determine whether replacing these SCFA’s can ameliorate the symptoms of ALS.  \r\n\r\nPurpose: We hypothesize that supplementing SCFAs (acetate, butyrate and propionate) in the drinking water of male and female mice will slow the progression of ALS symptoms.  \r\n\r\nObjectives: We aim to evaluate the progression of ALS symptoms and the survival in the TDP43-A315T mouse model of ALS. We will focus on the ability to control limb movement and the survival of male and female mice given a combination of the three SCFAs that mimics the physiological levels of these molecules in the gastrointestinal tract. \r\nMethods: Male and female mice with a genetic TDP43-A315T mutation (TDP43 mice) will be treated with a combination of three SCFAs in their drinking water from 6 weeks of age. Age-matched control TDP43 mice will receive modified drinking water with equivalent salt levels. Disease progression and body weight loss will be monitored continuously, with daily assessments at later stages. Motor dysfunction will be assessed in two ways: (1) with the tail suspension test (3 times per week after 10 weeks of age) and (2) the rotarod test to measure the latency to fall (weekly). Mice reaching the humane endpoint (~15 weeks in untreated males and ~34 weeks in untreated females) will be euthanized and tissue will be collected for the characterization of cells (brain, spinal cord, intestines), metabolites (blood) and gut microbiota (fecal samples). We will use 10 animals per group of each sex to achieve statistical significance, based on previous studies using this model.\r\nPotential Impact: Gut microbiome research has recently been flourishing as its critical importance to health is being better understood through novel research. The importance of the microbiome has been found to extend far beyond gut health, with emerging data pointing to strong links between the brain and gut. New understanding of the gut-brain axis is what led us to explore this novel approach to treating a neurodegenerative disorder (ALS) through the gut, not the brain. This treatment would establish a critical causal link between gut health and neurodegeneration in the brain through short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as a specific translational mediator. These findings will have an impact on gut microbiome research, as, despite strong correlations between the microbiome and brain often being observed, understanding of specific mechanisms is lacking due to the novelty of the field. \r\nThere is currently no cure for ALS and very few treatment options which positively impact quality of life and improve prognosis are available. If SCFA supplementation proves to delay disease progression, it will have immediate translational benefit to patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine supplementation on ALS progression through a cocktail of various potentially beneficial SCFAs, despite past literature pointing to the potential mediating effects of SCFAs on neurodegeneration. The SCFA supplementation proposed is a potential safe, non-invasive, treatment to ALS that would not be expected to have any negative side effects. The barrier to SCFA supplementation would be exceptionally low, due to ease of supplementation and relatively low cost. Furthermore, opening the door to treating neurological disorders through the gut microbiome via specific supplementation could prove to be a viable new strategy extending to treatments of other neurological disorders beyond ALS.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable brain disease that leads to loss of motor control and eventual death. Certain bacteria that live in the gut are present in lower levels for individuals with ALS, and we believe that their disappearance may have something to do with the damage caused by ALS. These bacteria are likely responsible for producing short chain fatty acids, which might help maintain brain health. We are testing whether the introduction of three of these specific short chain fatty acids through supplementation could help lessen the severity of brain degeneration in mice with ALS.",,"Gut, SCFAS, Supplementation, Microbiome",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ,n,Gut-Brain Axis,SCFAs in Drinking Water,Symptom Reduction,Animal,Translational,Nutraceutical,University of Calgary,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-bardhi-467099218/,,,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elina Provad,,Kristin Musselman,Stimulating Change in Cerebral Palsy Rehabilitation: An Implementation Intervention to Increase Use of Functional Electrical Stimulation      OLD TITLE: Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating a personalized balance intervention to Improve Walking Performance in Adults with Cerebral Palsy,"In Canada, the leading cause of physical disability in children is cerebral palsy (CP), with 2-2.5\/1000 children affected per year [1]. CP is caused by damage to the brain acquired in utero or early childhood, resulting in permanent motor and sensory impairments [2]. CP is a lifelong condition, and while it cannot be cured, symptoms can often be managed with therapy, pharmacological intervention, and assistive devices. In Canada, extensive resources are available for children with CP, yet few exist for adults, despite worsening mobility challenges with age [3]. Previous literature has identified falls and fear of falling as leading causes of walking regression in adults with CP (ACP) [4]. However, few balance interventions to improve walking performance in ACP have been investigated and none have targeted reactive balance control, the ability to recover stability after a loss of balance. For many ambulant ACP, falls and near falls occur daily because of insufficient reactive responses to unforeseen balance disturbances during walking [4]. A large portion of falls result in physical and psychological injuries, leading to decreased community participation [5-7]. We aim to investigate if a reactive balance training intervention coupled with personalized functional electrical stimulation (FES) will improve upright standing and walking performance and reduce the incidence of falls in ACP.\r\n\r\nWe aim to recruit twenty ACP that are (i) 18-39 years of age, (ii) able to ambulate 10 meters with or without aid and (iii) able to follow simple instructions in English. The study will exclude participants that have (i) skin breakdown on areas where the safety harness or FES is donned, (ii) any other condition that impacts balance or walking, (iii) a history of fragility fracture, and\/or (iv) pregnancy. A pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted. All participants will complete a baseline assessment and will be randomized into either (A) a control group (n=10) receiving usual care (i.e. no intervention), or (B) an intervention group (n=10) receiving reactive balance training. The intervention group will attend 12 one-hour training sessions (twice weekly for six weeks). Participants will practice challenging balance tasks in standing and walking that link to their goals. Each training session will involve approximately 45 perturbations (a push or pull), with one occurring every minute [8]. The perturbations will be strong enough to cause a reactive step, which is a step taken to prevent a fall. During the intervention, participants will wear a safety harness that will not support their weight but will prevent falls to the ground. The harness will be attached to a frame that allows movement in multiple directions. Additionally, the MyndSearch 2.0 FES System will be used on the lower limb muscles during training activities. This is an eight-channel FES system that can be used to create personalized stimulation protocols for muscles of the limbs and trunk. Most other FES systems available in Canada have 2-4 channels only, limiting the number of muscles that can be stimulated in a single application. With the MyndSearch 2.0, stimulation protocols will be personalized to each participant’s unique sensorimotor impairments. For both participant groups, there will be a midpoint assessment after the third week of intervention and a final assessment immediately following intervention completion, and at three- and six-months post-intervention. Participants in the control group will complete assessments at the same time points as the intervention group, and then receive reactive balance training as per the intervention group. \r\n\r\nThe primary outcome will be the participants’ ability to recover their balance using a single step during the Lean-and-Release test, used to measure reactive stepping responses [9]. The test simulates a forward fall in standing, prompting a step reaction [9]. Thirteen test trials will be conducted per assessment, with ten true and three false trials to reduce the use of anticipatory balance strategies. The secondary outcomes include three valid clinical measures for the ACP population [10]: (i) Falls Efficacy Scale - International, a 16-item questionnaire that evaluates falling concern [11]; (ii) Mini-BESTest: Balance Evaluation Systems Test, used to assess anticipatory, reactive, sensory, and dynamic balance control during standing and walking [12]; and (iii) Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, to self-report confidence in standing and walking [10]. \r\n\r\nDemographic information, the number and type of step reactions occurring during training sessions, the number of falls during the follow-up period, and performance on outcome measures will be collected. Group data will be analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance. Analysis of the main effect of time, the main effect of group and the interaction between the two main effects will be calculated. As well, a chi-square test of independence will be used to analyze the categorical data (i.e., “single step” vs. “not a single step”) obtained by the Lean-and-Release test. \r\n\r\nWe hypothesize that a reactive balance training program coupled with personalized FES will improve balance control and balance confidence, reducing the incidence of falls and concern about falling in ACP. Similar effects have been demonstrated in adults with other non-neurodegenerative conditions [13-14]. \r\n\r\nBy 2031, the number of Canadians living with CP is projected to increase from >75,000 in 2011 to >94,000 (15). These individuals require ongoing medical and rehabilitative care, and supports for independent or assistive living, occupation, and education [15]. Also, the healthcare expenditures of ACP are 7-10 times greater than that of Canadian adults without CP; the economic impact is high [15]. Furthermore, ACP report a lack of rehabilitative services in adulthood and unmet rehabilitation goals, with safe walking without falling being a top priority [16]. Innovative solutions are needed to address the gap in knowledge and clinic care, and demand for rehabilitation services for ACP as they age [17]. This research project aims to fill this gap, improving rehabilitation for an underserved population and potentially leading to better walking ability, fewer falls, and increased participation in daily and physical activity. Improved mobility could also lead to reduced healthcare costs and improved quality of life. The data generated from this RCT will be used to inform recommendations for gait and balance training for ACP to be used by physical therapists.","Cerebral palsy is a leading cause of physical disability, caused by damage to the brain occurring around birth. It often affects someoneʼs ability to move and balance. Frequently, walking ability gets worse with age because of poor balance control and fear of falling. Few balance treatments exist to address walking difficulties in adults with cerebral palsy. We aim to compare the balance and walking abilities of adults with cerebral palsy who receive standard care (i.e. no walking rehabilitation) to those who receive a novel balance treatment combined with technology that helps muscles function better, to improve standing and walking ability.",,"Balance, ACP, Intervention, Walking, Training, Reactive",Cerebral Palsy,n,Balance,FES,"Rehabilitation, Mobility",Human,,"Mind and Body, Tech",University of Toronto,2024,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=blDhmoYAAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/elina-provad/,,https://sites.google.com/view/scimoblab/home,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Georgia Elliott,,Leah Mayo,Perceptions and Outcomes of Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy in Canadian Veterans,"Rationale\r\nCanadian Veterans (CV) have a 10-15%[1] likelihood of being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating and highly comorbid psychiatric condition[1,2]. Dropout rates for PTSD treatment are high[3] and stigma surrounding access reduces CV seeking aid[4]. A study looking at standard PTSD treatment outcomes in veterans suggests that symptom improvement was not significantly different when combining the two most common front-line treatments, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), compared to using either in isolation[5]. This finding highlights the need for novel, efficacious PTSD treatments. \r\n\r\nRecently, psychedelic-assisted therapy for PTSD has garnered attention of the public and researchers. Preliminary findings suggest that 1-3 dosing sessions produces improvements in PTSD symptoms, and unlike many current pharmacotherapies, may have fewer side effects[6]. However, many clinical trials have exclusion criteria in place to protect patients, which limits veterans receiving treatment due to head injury\/trauma or certain comorbidities[7]. The current Canadian regulatory climate places this research at a pivotal point with a need for data regarding perceptions of and barriers to psychedelics and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe purpose of this two-part proposal is to investigate the current landscape surrounding psychedelic therapy specifically in a CV population. This will be carried out together with Heroic Hearts Canada (HHC), a registered Canadian charity that strives to provide safe access to psychedelic therapies for CV. Study 1 will focus on CV perceptions and beliefs towards psychedelic therapies. Study 2 will assess outcomes from CV who gain access to psychedelic therapies through HHC’s General Access Program. Ethics approval has been granted from the University of Calgary for study 1 (REB23-0843) and study 2 (REB23-1341).\r\n\r\nStudy 1 will focus on perceptions and beliefs surrounding psychedelic-assisted therapies in the CV community. It will be conducted using a survey consisting of validated questionnaires and open-ended questions regarding mental health issues, pain, and sleep disorders. Additionally, feelings about prior psychedelic experiences, current motivation to attain psychedelics, and barriers and other factors (i.e., stigma) that may impede use or access will also be explored[8–11]. Recruitment for this study will be conducted through HHC by means of email, social-media campaigns, and word-of-mouth and include 50 participants (N=50). \r\n\r\nStudy 2, which will happen concurrently, is a rolling-basis observational study of outcomes related to psychedelic-assisted therapy in CV who are enrolled in HHC’s General Access Program. The General Access Program provides CV with safe access to psychedelic therapies, either through Health Canada’s Special Access Program or vetted international retreat centres[12]. Individuals who enroll in HHC’s General Access Program will be asked to participate in our study, in which we will assess psychological[8,9,13–18] and clinical[19–21] outcomes relevant to their psychedelic experience and clinical diagnoses, with survey points occurring a week prior to the dosing session, day of dosing session and 4 follow-up intervals.\r\n\r\nHypotheses\r\nThe primary aim of Study 1 is to investigate and describe the experiences of CV regarding their perceptions of psychedelics, barriers or challenges to accessing psychedelics, and, for those who have sought psychedelic therapy, outcomes related to their experiences (in both legal or ‘underground’ contexts). This is an exploratory study that will be used to guide future research and initiatives. For instance, if our analysis suggests that stigma is a barrier to psychedelic use, we will work with HHC to generate relevant psychoeducational material targeting CV. We will also share this information with relevant stakeholders, such as healthcare workers, advocacy groups, and others in the CV community.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of Study 2 is to describe the psychedelic experience in the context of a therapeutic setting in CV and determine if psychedelic therapies are effective in a veteran population. Overall, we expect to see reductions in PTSD symptoms as measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)[21] in CV in the General Access Program. Our secondary hypothesis is that participants will report improvements in overall health and comorbid symptoms. \r\n\r\nImpact \r\nIn November 2023, a Canadian Senate subcommittee on Veteran Affairs released a report advocating for access to psychedelic-assisted therapy for CV[1]. Thus, our project is exceptionally timely, as it will explore attitudes of CV towards psychedelic-assisted therapy and provide novel observational data within this under-studied population. HHC’s General Access Program guides CV through Canada’s Special Access Program, which is unique to Canada and only one of two programs globally where patients can be legally prescribed psychedelics outside of a clinical trial. With this context, our research can provide original data and unique perspective which could guide psychedelic regulation on a global scale.","This project aims to explore psychedelics as a novel mental health intervention for Canadian Veterans (CV). In two related projects, we will first explore the beliefs towards, perceptions of, and barriers to accessing psychedelic therapies in this population. In study 2, we will collect real-world observational data from CV who receive access to psychedelics through the Heroic Hearts Canada, a registered Canadian charity facilitating safe and equitable access to psychedelics for CV. This will provide critical real-world evidence of the potential efficacy of psychedelics in CV.",,"Psychedelic, Access, Study, Program, HHC",Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,y,,Psychedelic-assisted therapy,Rehabilitation,Human,Basic,"Nutraceutical, Mind and Body",University of Calgary,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgia-elliott-36a34b303/,,https://www.thinclab.ca/,Queen's University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prerana Keerthi,,Luka Milosevic,Personalized Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease,"Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to various motor and non-motor symptoms such as akinesia (impaired movement initiation), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and cognitive changes (1,2). Though pharmacological interventions, such as the dopaminergic agonist levodopa, can reduce symptoms, these effects diminish as the disease progresses and such treatments can induce several side effects including cognitive impairments or dyskinesias (involuntary movements) (3). An alternative therapy commonly used to manage motor symptoms of PD and other movement disorders is deep brain stimulation (DBS), in which a surgically implanted device administers high-frequency stimulation to specific structures of the basal ganglia, specifically the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) (4). Though this treatment significantly reduces symptoms, conventional DBS provides continuous stimulation which drains battery life, increases the likelihood of stimulation-induced adverse effects, and can result in decreased effectiveness over time (5). A promising improvement to DBS involves the use of a neural or kinematic feedback signal (biomarker) that tracks patient states to determine when to stimulate in a paradigm called adaptive DBS (aDBS) (5). Though control paradigms based on single biomarkers, such as spectral power in the beta-band frequency range (12-35 Hz) of the patient’s subthalamic local field potential (LFP), have alleviated symptoms in some patients experimentally, these biomarkers do not fully capture patients’ clinical severity or their state of motion indicating the need for alternate, patient-specific control strategies (5–7). Recent studies have proposed the use of machine-learning (ML) algorithms that combine features from multiple frequency bands to decode movement intention and stimulate when the patient is in motion, thereby stimulating to reinforce volitional movement (8,9). ML-based aDBS has been implemented to reduce kinetic tremor in patients with essential tremor, however this method of personalized, movement-triggered aDBS has not been evaluated for reduction of akinetic\/bradykinetic symptoms in PD (10,11). We propose a personalized ML-based aDBS control paradigm for PD in which movement intention is decoded from power in multiple frequency bands of patients’ STN-LFP, thus stimulating immediately before movement initiation.\r\nMethods: The algorithm to classify movement will be trained from LFP data from the DBS implant collected during STN-DBS implantation surgery. The experiment will follow a similar method described by Houston et al. (10) in which training data will be collected by asking patients to move and rest for multiple 10-second blocks in alternate order. When asked to move, the patient will repeatedly pronate and supinate the hand contralateral to the implant as quickly and as fully as possible, a task on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale intended to assess bradykinesia (12). Patients will perform this task on and off stimulation, such that the classification algorithm can account for changes in motion-related neural dynamics induced by stimulation (10). Band power features will be extracted from the LFP in sliding intervals, with each interval labelled as a movement intention (the period between movement cue and movement initiation), movement, or rest sample. The features used to decode motion state include theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), low beta (13-20 Hz), high beta (21-35 Hz), low gamma (60-80 Hz), high gamma (90-200 Hz), and high-frequency oscillation (HFO; 201-400 Hz) power, which have each been used in movement decoding in the STN (8,9)]. Classifiers will be trained to determine motion states from these features and will be selected with consideration to high accuracy (> 80%), fast training period, and fast real-time implementation. Once trained, the best-performing algorithm will be immediately implemented in real-time to control stimulation, such that the DBS implant will stimulate when movement intention or movement is decoded (i.e. when the patient intends to move or is moving). This protocol will be compared against the no-stimulation and continuous-stimulation protocols, evaluated in randomized order. During evaluation, the patient will be asked to repeat the pronation-supination task with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) strapped to their wrist to assess speed and amplitude of movement. The outcomes that will be evaluated include the relative reduction in bradykinesia determined by speed along the primary axis of motion measured via the IMU and the relative reduction in akinesia measured by time between the cue to move and movement initiation.\r\nHypotheses: We hypothesize that with the provided features, patient-specific decoding algorithms can be trained to accurately classify motion states with > 80% accuracy in line with previous work (8–11). We hypothesize that the weights of the features used to classify movement will be heterogeneous across patients and vary by patients’ dominant symptoms and disease severity (7,13). For example, previous work has shown that movement-related low-beta modulation is stronger in tremor-dominant PD patients compared to akinetic-rigid type patients, indicating that it may be weighted more heavily in personalized movement decoding algorithms in patients of this category (7). We additionally hypothesize that in trials where the aDBS algorithm can accurately predict the motion intention and motion period, aDBS and continuous stimulation will result in similar symptom reduction relative to no stimulation. \r\nImpact: This study will be the first to investigate patient-specific movement decoding algorithms for reinforcing movement in aDBS for Parkinson’s disease. An aDBS control paradigm that only stimulates once the patient begins to move may deliver stimulation later than required as it is unable to reduce akinesia characterized by the prolonged period between motion intention and execution in patients with PD (9). This consideration motivates our design choice of decoding movement intention in addition to the movement period. In addition to potential improvement in DBS benefit, the proposed aDBS strategy can elucidate mechanisms of DBS by pinpointing precise stimulation times that can reinforce pathways linking movement intention to action (9). The relative importance of features trained in each personalized classifier will also help characterize interpatient variability in movement decoding, yielding insight into heterogeneities in the pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Though this study targets akinetic\/bradykinetic symptoms in PD patients, the personalized ML-based approach to aDBS can be extended to other movement disorders and symptoms, thus inspiring similar studies in different patient populations.","Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) is an intervention commonly used to treat Parkinsonʼs disease and other neurological disorders. During DBS, patients are implanted with a device that provides electrical current to targeted brain regions. DBS successfully reduces symptoms, however this therapy provides continuous stimulation which results in unwanted side effects. Research suggests that stimulating adaptively according to feedback signals from the brain can reduce symptoms while limiting side effects, as stimulation is only provided when necessary. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive stimulation system that will optimize when to stimulate based on the patientʼs state of motion.",,"Movement, Stimulation, Motion",Parkinson's Disease,n,Biomarker, ML-based aDBS,"Adaptation, Mobility",Human,,"Tech, Personalized Treatment",University of Toronto,2024,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TR_RJ50AAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/prerana-keerthi/,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prerana-Keerthi,https://torontotnbs.com/,University of Toronto,,,,prerana.keerthi@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colby Sandberg,,Marie-Ève Tremblay,The impacts of prenatal delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure on the phagocytic activity and neurodevelopmental role of microglia,"Rationale\r\nThe increasing accessibility and consumption of cannabis in recent years has highlighted the need for further research on its health impacts. Cannabis use during pregnancy in particular has significantly increased in the past two decades (from 1.3% to 7.5% in a Nova Scotia study) and is associated with increased risks of adverse neonatal outcomes(1,3). Among the compounds found in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid associated with such outcomes. Prenatal THC exposure is linked to neurodevelopmental alterations like short-term memory deficits and increased neuropsychiatric morbidity risks, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined(2,4,5). \r\nNeurodevelopment is a critical pre- and postnatal period susceptible to disturbances like THC exposure. Microglia play key roles in neurodevelopment often relating to their phagocytic function, like eliminating neural precursor cells (NPCs) to regulate their populations during embryonic neurogenesis and pruning synapses to shape neuronal circuits throughout postnatal development(6-9). Microglia also express cannabinoid receptors that can be directly targeted by THC(11). Prenatal THC exposure is associated with altered mouse hippocampal NPC proliferation and differentiation(18). Prenatal THC is also associated with alterations in microglial morphology toward more surveying states in the adult rat hippocampus, with sex-dependent differences in certain regions, for instance only females showing decreased circularity in CA1 stratum radiatum(14). THC also disrupts whole-brain microglial homeostasis and potentially promotes an ‘activation-resistant’ microglial state in adolescent mice(12). \r\nConsidering the links between THC, microglial function, and neurodevelopment, this project aims to examine how prenatal THC exposure impacts microglial phagocytosis. I will focus on phagocytic activity linked to neuronal modeling in the developing brain, as well as sex-and age-dependent differences in susceptibility to such THC-induced impacts. I will focus my investigation on the hippocampus due to the robust expression of cannabinoid receptors on hippocampal microglia, and the abundant literature on the developmental roles of microglia in this region(6,8,13,15). Altered microglial function in the hippocampus can result in significant changes in neuronal circuits and behaviour, such as impaired microglial phagocytosis being associated with increased synaptic density(9,16,17).\r\n\r\nHypothesis\r\n\tI hypothesize that prenatal THC exposure will lead to reduced microglial phagocytosis resulting from functional impairments at both embryonic and developmental stages in THC-exposed offspring relative to controls. I also expect reduced phagocytic activity to impair embryonic NPC population regulation and neonatal synaptic pruning. Furthermore, I anticipate sex-dependent difference in these impacts, with THC-exposed males showing larger phagocytic activity deficits relative to females based on the literature notably showing exacerbated microglial phagocytosis deficits in male mice exposed to maternal immune activation(9).\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nProject Aim: Examine the Effects of Prenatal THC Exposure on Microglial Phagocytic Activity\r\n\tI will use male and female C57BL\/6J mouse offspring groups at two ages, embryonic day (E)17 and postnatal day(P)14. All animal work has been completed by our collaborators from the CoBrA Lab at the Douglas Research Centre. Dams were administered daily subcutaneous injections from E3-10, with THC-exposed dams receiving 5 mg\/kg THC (in a preparation of THC:cremophor:saline), and control dams receiving 5 mg\/kg cremophor:saline. The region of interest will be the hippocampus. \r\n\tTo examine microglial phagocytosis, I will perform immunohistochemistry for the phagolysosomal marker CD68 and different microglial markers selected based on their developmental expression; the purinergic receptor P2RY12 (E17) and microglial\/macrophage calcium binding protein IBA1 (P14)(6,20,21). Using confocal microscopy, I will examine the number of cells positive(+) for both CD68 and a microglial marker (P2RY12\/IBA1), and the number of CD68 puncta per P2RY12+ or IBA1+ cell as indicators of phagocytic activity. I will also examine embryonic NPC density in E17 animals by labeling the transcription factor Tbr2 required for hippocampal neurogenesis as an NPC marker, then analyze microglial phagocytosis of NPC by quantifying Tbr2 labeling inside P2RY12+CD68+ cells(22,23). I will examine dendritic spine density in P14 animals by labeling PSD95, a postsynaptic density marker present in dendritic spines, then analyze phagocytosis via PSD95 labeling inside IBA1+CD68+ cells(17).\r\nTo obtain an effect size of 0.2, we will use 4-6 mice\/sex\/group, and image 20-25 microglia\/animal. I will examine one male and female per litter to prevent litter effects. Data will be analyzed by a 2-way ANOVA (sex and THC exposure) using GraphPad Prism with p&lt;0.05 indicating statistical significance.\r\n\r\nPotential Impact \r\n\tIncreasing rates of prenatal cannabis use highlight the need for a better understanding of how THC affects microglial function and neurodevelopment. Public accessibility to such knowledge is vital, considering increasing THC potency in cannabis products(1,24-26). This project will provide valuable insight on how THC impacts the neurodevelopmental phagocytic activity of microglia. My project will also provide data on sex-dependent differences in THC impacts for understudied ages in cannabis research.","This project aims to study how prenatal THC exposure affects microglia, the immune cells of the brain. Microglia engage in a process called phagocytosis, where they engulf and break down cells and other materials. This function is important during brain development, when microglia break down certain excess neural cells and trim down the connections between neurons. This allows microglia to build more efficient neuronal circuits and shape behaviour. Understanding how THC impacts the ability of microglia to do this will help us better determine the importance of microglia during neural development and the long-term risks of using cannabis during pregnancy.",,"THC, Microglial, Exposure, Phagocytosis, Prenatal",n/a,n,Microglia,THC/Cannabis,"Pregnancy, Development",Animal,Basic,Nutraceutical,University of Victoria,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Colby-Sandberg-2275864579,https://neuroimmuneplasticity.ca/,University of Victoria,,,,colbysandberg@uvic.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Antonia Landwehr,,Marie-Ève Tremblay,Microglial roles in the effect of light flickering stimulation on mood and cognition: outcomes on synaptic plasticity and brain remodelling in a mouse model of depression,"By the year 2030, major depressive disorder (MDD) is predicted to be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide[1]. Standard treatment options for MDD face several limitations, including delayed onset of action, high rates of refractoriness, and severe side effects, leading to frequent treatment discontinuation[1 2].\r\n\r\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain’s capacity to adjust the strength of neuronal connections in response to external and internal stimuli, leading to the reshaping of neuronal networks[3]. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, were shown to be critically involved in the molecular mechanisms behind neuroplasticity, by regulating neurogenesis and the formation, maturation and elimination of synapses[4]. Chronic psychological stress (CS) plays a central role in the development of depressive symptomatology[5]. For example, through the excessive release of glucocorticoids and their effects on brain limbic regions, such as the hippocampus, CS was shown to affect the emergence of depressive-like behaviour[6 7]. CS was further shown to induce abnormal microglial states, such as dystrophic and dark states. Notably, dark microglia are a microglial subset first described by the Tremblay lab, which is highly upregulated after CS in targeted brain regions (e.g., the hippocampus) and shows markers of cellular stress (e.g., dilated endoplasmic reticulum and ultrastructurally altered mitochondria)[8]. \r\n\r\nThrough the release of signalling molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and the process of phagocytosis, microglia are critically involved in the remodelling of the extracellular matrix and perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are lattice-like extracellular matrix structures surrounding predominantly groups of fast-spiking interneurons, including parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (STT)-interneurons[9 22]. A balance between PNN maintenance and degradation determines the outcomes on synaptic plasticity of different environmental challenges, including CS[10 11]. In adulthood, PNNs mostly surround inhibitory interneurons and are implicated in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory outputs, with its disbalance being implicated in psychiatric disorders, including depression[12 13]. Additionally, CS was associated with a higher density of PNNs in the mouse hippocampus, while the treatment with antidepressants, including ketamine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, was able to reduce PNN density and induce plasticity-promoting actions[14]. \r\n\r\nAbnormal microglial functioning, including reduced microglial MMP secretion, induced by pathological states, such as CS, may be linked to aberrant modulation of PNNs, resulting in deficits in synaptic plasticity and behaviour[7 15 16]. It is well-known that the novel fast-acting antidepressant agent ketamine reaches its antidepressant effect by modulating pathways leading to increased synaptic plasticity[16 17]. However, ketamine is associated with severe side effects, including hallucinations and abuse liability, limiting its feasibility as a broad therapeutic approach across different groups of patients[18]. Furthermore, Cornwell et al. (2012)[19] revealed that the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine was associated with changes in brain oscillatory activity, notably the induction of waves in the gamma range (30-100 Hz). Similarly, light flickering stimulation (LFS) is a non-pharmacological approach able to entrain gamma range of oscillations in the brain of mice and humans[20 21]. Evidence provided by Venturino et al. (2021)[21] indicates that LFS at 60 Hz affected microglial phagocytic activity, reflected in the upregulation of the microglial phagocytic marker CD68, and the colocalization of microglia with PNN structures, which was associated with a massive removal of PNNs in the somatosensory cortex of adult mice[21]. Through this mechanism involving microglia, LFS at 60 Hz was shown to promote a marked reinstatement of juvenile-like plasticity states in the adult brain. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I hypothesize that: i) CS induces marked functional and structural alterations of microglia, culminating with the loss of these cells’ ability to properly reshape the extracellular matrix, notably PNNs, leading to synaptic plasticity impairment; ii) LFS can attenuate microglial alterations resulting from CS, modulating their functions towards promoting the reshaping of PNNs, with antidepressant-related outcomes on synaptic plasticity and behaviour.\r\n\r\nYoung adult (8-10 weeks) C57BL\/6J wild-type mice will be used. Considering marked sex differences in microglial functions and stress reactivity, I will examine males and females in each experiment with a sufficient sample size to assess sex differences[22]. As a translationally relevant animal model of depression, mice will be exposed to 35 days of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), involving two different stressors per day or gentle handling (as a control condition)[23]. On day 30 of the protocol, mice will be exposed to LFS at 40 Hz and 60 Hz or constant light (control condition) in a light stimulation box (available in the Tremblay lab), for 2 h\/day for 5 consecutive days (N:12\/condition\/sex), as done previously[21 22].\r\n\r\nOn day 36, 24 h after LFS or control light, all mice will be evaluated on the following behavioural domains, from least to most invasive\/stressful, using paradigms routinely performed in the Tremblay Lab: anxiety and locomotion (open-field test)[24], anhedonia (sucrose preference test)[25], coping behaviour (forced swimming test)[26]. Subsequently, mice will be transcardially perfused, and ventral hippocampus slices (50 µm), Bregma 2.92 to 3.08, will be obtained using an automated vibratome. These regions and layers of interest were chosen based on their known abundance of abnormal microglial states, e.g., dystrophic and dark, after CS exposure[29]. I will perform high throughput slide scanning epifluorescence microscopy to analyze microglial density and distribution in the cornu ammonis 1 (strata radiatum and pyramidale) and dentate gyrus (polymorphic layer), regions shown to be involved in plasticity, and affected by CS[30], using the microglial\/macrophage marker Iba1 and microglia-selective marker TMEM119. Microglial morphology will be analyzed using an automated pipeline developed by the Tremblay lab using open-source software such as ImageJ[26]. Microglial interactions (using the phagolysosome marker CD68) with PNNs [labelled by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)], and inhibitory interneurons (labelled by PV and SST antibodies), will be examined by confocal microscopy. Colocalization analysis will be performed using published CellProfiler pipelines (N:6\/condition\/sex)[27]. Brain sections will be processed for electron microscopy and imaged at the nanoscale by automated 3D-focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy. Microglial ultrastructural states (e.g., dark, dystrophic, etc.) and their relationships with PNNs and synapses (key expertise of the Tremblay Lab) will be quantified (N:5-6\/condition\/sex)[29].\r\n\r\nOverall, this project will facilitate an increased understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in MDD, and the development of a novel, technologically advanced treatment approach.","Light flickering stimulation (LFS) is a non-pharmacological approach used to regulate the brain oscillatory activity in specific waves that possesses promising applications for neuropsychiatric disorders. LFS showed effectiveness in synchronizing the brain in the spectrum of gamma waves, which are markedly disrupted in depression. LFS, like the novel-fast-acting antidepressant ketamine, affects the re-wiring of neuronal circuits by modulating the brainʼs immune cells, microglia. This capacity seems to be critical for the antidepressantʼs efficacy of ketamine. Here, we will determine whether LFS can mitigate the effects of chronic stress on neuronal networks through the modulation of microglia, and restore depression-like symptoms.",,"Microglial, Plasticity, Microglial, Perineuronal Nets (PNNs)","""Major Depressive Disorder, Stress""",y,Oscillatory Activity,Light-Flickering Stimulation (LFS),Symptom Reduction,Animal,,Personalized Treatment,University of Victoria,2024,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonia-landwehr-aaa2b4217/,,https://neuroimmuneplasticity.ca/,University of Victoria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
Nicholina Boutros,,Mark Boulos,Using Cannabis to Treat Restless Legs Syndrome: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Pilot Safety and Feasibility Trial,"Rationale and Background:\r\nRestless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes painful and uncomfortable sensations in the legs, and its symptoms have a significant impact on sleep and quality of life. Treatment options such as dopamine agents and alpha-2-delta ligands such as gabapentin are often recommended as first-line therapy, however, these medications can decrease in efficacy over time and patients may also develop augmentation of their symptoms.[1] Augmentation in RLS is the progressive worsening of RLS symptoms beyond initial severity in response to dopaminergic treatments.[2] This can leave patients’ symptoms unmanaged, and requires escalating dosages or medication changes. Moreover, many current treatment options can have unwanted or debilitating side effects such as nausea and dizziness, or lead to impulse control disorders.[2] RLS can often be inadequately treated, due to side effects or incomplete treatment response, indicating a need for alternative treatment options.[3]\r\n \r\nThe analgesic effects of cannabis may be useful for treating the sensory manifestations of RLS.[4] Cannabinoid receptors are distributed throughout the pain pathways, most densely in the brain and spinal cord, and cannabis has been shown to help with the management of pain disorders.[2] Cannabis use has also been reported to reduce dopamine synthesis,[5] which may counteract the increased dopamine production seen in RLS.[6] There are also sleep-inducing properties of cannabis that may help RLS patients fall asleep.[7] Moreover, the side effects of cannabis have been shown to be limited, and are often restricted to high doses of THC.[8] Occurrences of adverse events can be limited by starting at lower doses of THC (and not exceeding 20-30 mg\/day) and administering THC in conjunction with cannabidiol (CBD).[8] A 1-year safety study looking at medical cannabis found that there was no difference in serious adverse event rates in cannabis users compared to controls.[9] However, some common side effects of cannabis use include drowsiness, dry mouth and cognitive issues.[8]\r\n \r\nRecent case reports have indicated that there may be benefits for using cannabis in patients with moderate to severe RLS.[10, 11] The patients in these reports suffered from severe RLS symptoms and found limited efficacy from current pharmacological therapies. Patients (N=18 combined) reported self-administering cannabis to treat persistent symptoms, and all but one patient experienced relief. These reports also noted that cannabis was well-tolerated. In another study that included medical cannabis users with sleep disorders (including RLS), they found that 93% of patients self-reported improvement in sleep quality after 6 weeks.[12] The data from these case reports are promising but limited, and a randomized controlled trial investigating the use of cannabis to treat RLS is needed to establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for RLS.\r\n \r\nMethods:\r\nThis pilot study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, parallel group, controlled trial. Cannabis will be administered as an adjunctive therapy; thus, patients will not be required to discontinue their current RLS therapies and changes to these therapies will not be permitted during the trial. We will aim to recruit a sample of 30 participants (15 in each study arm) with moderate-to-severe RLS. Outcomes including questionnaires and home sleep testing will be assessed at baseline and 8-week follow up. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms for 8 weeks: i) CBD:THC oil (‘Cannabis group’), or ii) placebo oil (‘Placebo group’). They will be directly sent the study drug, and there will be a 4-week titration period. Starting at 1mL per night, they will adjust titration each week to a maximum of 8mL per night.\r\n \r\nHypotheses:\r\nWe hypothesize that using cannabis to treat RLS will be feasible, as measured by rates of recruitment and study completion, and safe, as measured by the incidence of adverse events. We secondarily hypothesize that cannabis may improve quality of life, RLS symptom severity, objective sleep measures and subjective sleep quality.\r\n \r\nPotential Impact:\r\nIf cannabis is found to be feasible and safe for the management of RLS symptoms, the results of this study will be used to design a larger trial that will be adequately powered to determine the efficacy of using cannabis to treat RLS. Cannabis may provide the much-needed relief sought out by patients who are currently suffering from this debilitating condition. Moreover, medical cannabis is a relatively affordable treatment option, which may make it more accessible to many patients compared to other treatment alternatives. Importantly, cannabis may result in fewer or less severe side effects compared to current therapies, which may lead to improved quality of life.","Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes painful and uncomfortable sensations in the legs, and its symptoms have a significant impact on sleep and quality of life. Cannabis has been used by some RLS patients as a treatment due to its painkilling and sedating effects, however, there has never been a clinical research trial investigating cannabis in patients with RLS. In our study, thirty participants with RLS will receive either cannabis or placebo for 8 weeks. We will measure patientsʼ sleep quality and quality of life at baseline and 8-week follow-up. We will also monitor for adverse reactions.",,"Cannabis, Sleep, Quality, THC",Restless Leg Syndrome,n,Pain,Cannabis,"Quality of Life, Sleep, Pain Management",Human,,Nutraceutical,University of Toronto,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholina-boutros-8960a029b,,,McMaster University ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Andres Martinez,,Martin Ferguson-Pell,Integrative design of Virtual Reality (VR) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to improve and extend the quality of life of patients with motor neuron disorders.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. The incidence of ALS is approximately 1.6, 0.1, and 2.05 per 100,000 people worldwide, in Canada, and in Alberta, respectively (Government of Canada, 2013). This disease is twice as common in men than women, and it typically appears around age 55-65. Symptoms of ALS can mimic other neuromuscular diseases; it is usually diagnosed after approximately 1 year. Weakness in the limbs (spinal onset, >60%) or difficulty in speaking or swallowing (bulbar onset) are typical symptoms of ALS (Ball et al., 2001). The prognosis is a median survival rate of 3-5 years, but around 30% of patients remain alive after 5 years and 10% after 10 years, usually with profound physical disabilities (Brotman et al., 2024; Longinetti & Fang, 2019).\r\nTwo emerging technologies present opportunities to improve quality of life in the social and motor aspects of ALS patients. Extended reality (XR) simulates environments using head-mounted-displays, creating unique experiences where users can interact in a virtual world (Pottle, 2019). XR technologies have been used for telemedicine and rehabilitation in neuronal diseases, including in treating ALS and stroke (Nadeau et al., 2024; Trevizan et al., 2018). Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) can be used to treat different conditions where patients lose motor control. BCI compensates patients' motor activities with robotic actuators or orthotic devices that respond to brain electrical activity. For example, stroke patients have found that BCI can support their rehabilitation (Almulla et al., 2020; Roldán & Kyriacou, 2021). ALS patients with a locked-in state (LIS) and a completely locked-in state (CLIS) have shown favourable cognitive outcomes with BCI (Chaudhary et al., 2021; Spataro et al., 2017; Willett et al., 2023).\r\nTwo core BCI technologies are widely available. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects changes in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation associated with cognitive stimuli. The ability of fNIRS to localize areas of brain activity allows control of external devices. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an alternative technology that records brain activity. Real-time signal processing allows concentrated thought to control applications. BCI-based systems are already used to control simple functions like basic mouse or keyboard computer functions. Although they have recently demonstrated value for a small number of ALS patients, little is known about the relative merits of these two BCI systems for patients with profound physical disabilities. \r\n\r\nXR systems typically provide immersion by integrating user movement with virtual space. However, XR still offers meaningful opportunities to participate, and even collaborate, while sitting still. VR meeting platforms allow users to relax and enjoy virtual experiences or attend virtual meetings while stationary. BCI interfaced with XR offers people with significant disabilities the opportunity to interact in XR, reducing social isolation.\r\n\r\nBCI has been demonstrated in XR for people with typical functioning (for gaming applications), but using BCI-controlled XR headsets for people with limited head and body movements requires practical guidelines and novel approaches. In this study, we will demonstrate the use of BCI for people with profound physical disabilities and offer guidelines for their effective use. \r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nWe propose the integration of BCI-EEG and BCI-NIRS with XR headsets to allow patients with no voluntary neuromuscular functions to interact with a virtual environment. Two contrasting, commercially available XR applications will be used: one involving exploring a content-rich environment (such as a virtual museum or art gallery), and the other requiring point-and-shoot skills. These two use-cases will provide a rich opportunity to compare the two BCI modalities.\r\n\r\nPhase 1:\r\n10 non-disabled participants will be recruited to calibrate the BCI-XR system. Participants’ P300 measurement with random specific event-related potential (ERP) will be the main activity trigger. To filter the signal, we will use a band-pass filtered from 2 to 40 Hz, and Independent Component Analysis to obtain the Action Potential for each stimulus and its associated power spectrum (Li et al., 2023). For EEG, we will employ Discrete Wavelet Transformation to decompose the signals into their respective frequency bands (Nurfirdausi et al., 2022). The protocol for controlling the virtual environment will be implemented using the Lab Streaming Layer, which allows individuals to control an avatar using commands from brain signals (Sanchez-Cuesta et al., 2021).\r\n\r\nBCI modality performance will be evaluated in two ways. The User Experience Evaluation Framework (UXF) provides a comprehensive set of criteria for evaluating User Experience (UX) in XR applications (Alomari et al., 2020). It includes self-reported dimensions such as Presence, Interaction, Comfort, Realism, Adaptivity, Immersion, and Social Presence. Task performance metrics such as completion time, error rates, and task success rates can provide objective measures of usability and effectiveness in XR applications. Given the communication challenges of our participants, we will assemble a fusion of these two approaches that integrate performance with user satisfaction to holistically evaluate each BCI modality.\r\nPhase 2: \r\nA small clinical pilot study will be conducted with 5 ALS patients to establish the performance and acceptability of the two BCI modalities. The same UXF and Task Performance measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of BCI-XR on our desired population.\r\n\r\nIn addition to publishing the outcomes of this study, we intend to create a guideline document for the effective use of BCI controllers with XR simulations for people with profound disabilities. This work will define cutting-edge assistive technologies to support and improve the quality of life of people with profound physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nHypothesis:\r\nPatients with ALS can meaningfully interact with their loved ones and enjoy entertaining experiences through the integration of brain-computer interfaces and extended reality. \r\n\r\nPotential impact: ALS patients in LIS or CLIS have difficulty interacting with others, as they cannot perform voluntary motor activities, including moving their eyes. Loss of communication can often mean loss of connection and deeper meaning in life. The potential impact on quality of life in end-of-life care for these patients is incredibly meaningful, particularly for those patients who linger in LIS or CLIS states, as it can provide a road back to connection even as their disease progresses.\r\nTwo emerging technologies present opportunities to improve the quality of life in the social and motor aspects of ALS patients. Extended reality (XR) simulates environments using head-mounted displays (HMD). These XR simulations create unique experiences where users can interact in the virtual world, and this mechanism can be applied to external medical devices (Pottle, 2019). XR technologies have been used for telemedicine and rehabilitation in neuronal diseases, including in treating ALS and stroke (Nadeau et al., 2024; Trevizan et al., 2018).

These devices allow patients to compensate, communicate, and experience a better quality of life, by restoring some lost function and providing respite to caregivers. \r\nTwo core technologies are widely available to provide BCI function. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) detects changes in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation associated with cognitive stimuli. The ability of fNIRS to localize areas of brain activity allows people to control external devices. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an alternative technology that records brain activity. Real-time digital signal processing allows for the control of applications through concentrated thought.\r\n\r\nXR systems detect the movement of the user by integrating data from multiple sensors, including inertial measurement units (IMUs), optical tracking systems, and (in older systems) tethered, external lighthouses. However, XR technologies do offer meaningful opportunities to participate and even collaborate while sitting still. VR meeting and collaboration platforms allow users to relax and enjoy virtual experiences or attend virtual meetings and presentations while seated. BCI interfaced with XR offers people with significant disabilities the opportunity to use XR to reduce social isolation and have access to uplifting immersive content.\r\n\r\nBCI-based systems can be used to control simple functions such as basic mouse or keyboard computer functions.

Two contrasting commercially available XR applications to challenge the BCI UI method to control them (EEG vs fNIRS) will be used. One will involve moving through a content-rich environment such as a virtual museum or art gallery. The other will require point-and-shoot skills, as is required by many XR games. \r\nThe study will be conducted in two phases:\r\nPhase 1: Integration of BCI with XR\r\n10 able-bodied participants will use the BCI-XR system. The paradigm will be presented, and the P300 will be measured with random specific event-related potential (ERP). Filter the signal, we will use a band-pass filtered from 2 to 40 Hz, and independent Component analysis (ICA) to obtain the potential action in front of each stimulus and the power spectral of the potential (Li et al., 2023). Using a fusion of the UXFs of Lang et al (2018) and task performance metrics each participant will be asked to evaluate the performance of the two BCI controllers for each simulation.\r\nCareful qualitative observations will be made by the clinician fitting the controllers for usability and reliability. This phase of the project will enable a mature protocol to be developed for testing with patients in Phase 2.\r\nPhase 2: A small clinical pilot study will then be conducted with 5 ALS patients (or patients with similar diseases\/disorders) to establish the relative performance of the two BCI controllers and the two XR simulations. The UXF and the BCI-XR system will be used to obtain user feedback, and again, the usability of the two systems will be recorded and contrasted.\r\nKnowledge Translation: In addition to publishing the outcomes of this study we also intend to create a guideline document for the effective use of BCI controllers with XR simulations for people with profound disabilities. This work will define the cutting-edge of assistive technologies to support and improve the quality of life of people with profound physical limitations. Once peer-reviewed approval of this work has been obtained, we will use our extensive social media capability to obtain public support and a greater understanding of the potential that technology can offer to people experiencing the isolation of severe neurological conditions. \r\n\r\nThe UX Evaluation Frameworks for XR (UXF) proposed by Lang et al. (2018) provides a comprehensive set of criteria for evaluating UX in XR applications. It includes dimensions such as Presence, Interaction, Comfort, Realism, Adaptivity, Immersion, and Social Presence, among others. In addition to subjective assessments, task performance metrics such as completion time, error rates, and task success rates can provide objective measures of usability and effectiveness in XR applications. Given the communication challenges of our users, we will assemble a fusion of these two UXF approaches that focus on the value of BCI-enabled XR experiences to the user, and their task performance metrics.\r\n\r\nHypothesis:\r\nPatients with ALS can meaningfully interact with their loved ones through the integration of brain-computer interface and extended reality. \r\n\r\nPotential impact: ALS and motor neurodegenerative disorder patients in LIS or CLIS have difficulty interacting with others, as they cannot perform voluntary motor activities, including moving their eyes. Loss of communication can often mean loss of connection and deeper meaning in life. The potential impact on quality of life in palliative care for these patients is incredibly meaningful, particularly for those patients who linger in LIS or CLIS states, as it can provide a road back to connection even as their disease progresses.","Today, Fulanito-de-Tal would have been 60 years old, but he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in 2019, a neurodegenerative disease that affected his mobility for the five years before his death.

Ashley de Witte,,Maryam Faiz,Sex differences in butyric acid supplementation for post-stroke recovery,"Rationale\r\nStroke is the third leading cause of death in Canada and the leading cause of adult disability globally (1–3). The most prevalent type of stroke is ischemic stroke, in which occlusion of a cerebral artery leads to decreased blood supply, neuronal death, and ultimately neurological deficits (4,5). Importantly, stroke risk, pathological mechanisms and functional recovery have all been shown to vary across sex (6), but surprisingly, sex is largely understudied in the pathology of stroke.\r\n\r\nAn exciting new therapeutic strategy for stroke involves the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is a large community of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract (7). Through the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota can directly and indirectly influence CNS function in health and disease (7). Importantly, there are also sex differences in gut microbiota composition (8).\r\n\r\nRecently, studies have shown that stroke causes changes in gut microbiota composition, referred to as dysbiosis (9,10). This is closely linked to stroke outcomes, with further differences in males and females (Daniele et al. submitted). A consequence of stroke dysbiosis is alterations in microbial production of metabolites that can influence CNS function (7,11). For example, lower levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), products of dietary fibre fermentation, are associated with a worse stroke prognosis and poor functional outcomes (7,9,10,12). Specifically, butyrate (or butyric acid), one of the SCFAs, has been found to have the strongest negative correlation with poststroke neurological deficits, with males experiencing a more severe reduction in butyrate poststroke compared to females (13–15). \r\n\r\nGiven the importance of SCFAs in stroke outcomes, SCFA supplementation has been explored as a promising therapeutic approach in rodent models (13,16,17). Transplantation of SCFA-producing bacteria and, in particular, butyrate supplementation in male rodents improves recovery (13,16,17). In addition, it has been discovered that SCFA supplementation may be associated with microglial function and\/or activation (17,18). Microglia are CNS resident macrophages that monitor and maintain homeostasis (19). In response to stroke, microglia become activated, and undergo diverse morphological, molecular, and functional changes that influence stroke outcomes (19–21).\r\n\r\nDespite the known sex differences in stroke (6), the gut microbiota (8), and stroke-induced dysbiosis (Daniele et al. submitted), little is known about the effect of sex on gut-directed treatments. In a project previously funded by Branch Out, I examined the effect of butyrate in males and females. I found that while males show improved functional recovery in response to butyrate treatment, females do not. When I analyzed microglia, I found corresponding sex differences in their morphology. Female microglia were more ameboid, while male microglia were more ramified, morphologies that have previously been correlated with activated and resting phenotypes, respectively (22). Here, I propose to investigate the mechanisms that underlie these observed sex differences. I will test whether baseline sex differences in the gut microbiota drive the observed sexually dimorphic changes in functional recovery and microglial morphology following butyrate treatment.\r\n \r\n\r\nHypotheses\r\nI hypothesize that sex differences in the gut microbiota are driving the differential effects of butyrate treatment on males and females post-stroke. Therefore, I hypothesize that cross-sex transplantation of fecal matter pre-stroke, followed by butyrate treatment will result in improved functional recovery in female mice with male microbiota during acute stroke, while male mice with female microbiota will experience no functional recovery following post-stroke butyrate treatment.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nMice: 8–10-week-old male and female C57BL6 mice will be used in this study. Prior to the stroke, cross-sex fecal microbial transplants (FMTs) will be performed. For this, mice will be treated with antibiotics for 1 week prior to transplantation of feces from the opposite sex. 16s sequencing will be used to verify the success of the fecal transplant. \r\n\r\nEndothelin-1 model of stroke: Stroke will be induced as previously described (23–25). Sham-injured mice will be used as controls.\r\n\r\nButyrate treatment: Mice will be treated with sodium butyrate (40 µM) or sodium chloride (40 µm) in the drinking water, ad libitum, at stroke onset until the end of the study. \r\n\r\nBehaviour: Sensorimotor behaviour will be assessed using the cylinder task and ladder walking prior to stroke and at d4 post-stroke. Within-group (to baseline) and between-group comparisons will be performed. \r\n\r\n\r\nPotential Impact\r\nStroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in Canada (26). Ischemic stroke comprises around 80% of all strokes (4). It is caused by a reduction of blood flow to the brain that results in neural cell death and inflammation, and consequent deficits in function. Unfortunately, current treatments are limited and can only be administered in a fraction of patients due to a very narrow therapeutic time window (4). In potentially further elucidating the mechanisms behind the functional recovery following butyric acid treatment, this work may inform the targeted application of microbiome-based treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions and may reveal specific functional pathways that may be targeted to improve the precision of treatment beyond current microbiome approaches.","Stroke is a devastating brain disease with few effective treatments. Recently, it has been discovered that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria are reduced after stroke injury. Excitingly, when SCFAs are replenished, there is improved recovery in male animal models, however, the same recovery is not observed in females. In this project, we will examine why females do not recover the same way as males. By further understanding these differences, we will gain more insight into how SCFA improves recovery in stroke, which will hopefully push us further toward a new potential treatment for stroke.",,"Sex, Butyrate, Gut, Microbiota",Stroke,n,Gut-Brain Axis,"Butyrate treatment, Fecal transplant","Sex Differences, Treatment",Animal,"Basic, Translational",Nutraceutical,University of Toronto,2024,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-de-witte-142807237/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Madeleine Maheu,,"Paula Duarte-Guterman,  Rebecca MacPherson",Exercise: A Neurostructural Remodeling Perspective,"Background:\r\nExercise is widely accepted as a positive health behaviour, but there is a disconnect between what the public knows about exercise and what the scientific community understands about this topic. Most people know that exercise can help us maintain a healthy weight and improve strength as this is heavily portrayed in our media – but the benefits of exercise extend far beyond aesthetic purposes. \r\n\r\nUntil recent time, a disproportionate amount of research has focused on male individuals, as well as ageing and disease models in comparison to females and young healthy subjects. Accordingly, my work seeks to demonstrate how acute versus chronic aerobic exercise changes the brain through structural remodeling in young healthy adult male and female mice. Cognitive changes will also be examined to relate changes in brain structure to behaviour. A major goal of this work is to elucidate sex differences in brain remodelling with respect to different exercise regimes. That is, do males and females experience different neurostructural changes and cognitive benefits from acute versus chronic aerobic exercise?\r\n \r\nThis investigation will characterize plastic and inflammatory mechanisms within the brain and determine whether these mechanisms differ with respect to acute versus chronic exercise. Acute exercise results in an inflammatory response which over time with chronic exercise may result in plastic changes in the brain. In males, limited evidence suggests that acute aerobic exercise upregulates specific brain inflammatory markers, namely matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) within the hippocampus – a brain structure involved in learning and memory1. However, my Honours thesis work demonstrated that chronic aerobic exercise does not alter certain inflammatory markers (i.e., microglia) in the hippocampus of males and females2 highlighting possible different mechanistic adaptations between forms of exercise (acute vs chronic) with respect to neuroinflammation. Regarding neuroplasticity, exercise increases the production of new neurons in the hippocampus3, but there has been less research regarding other important components of adult brain plasticity such as the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is essential for brain development and for supporting connections (synapses) between neurons4. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are components of the ECM that are involved in the stabilization of synapses5. My Honours thesis work demonstrated that chronic aerobic exercise reduces PNNs in the hippocampus of female and male mice2. Fewer PNNs were also correlated with improved spatial learning and memory outcomes2. However, the mechanisms behind PNN reduction in exercised mice remain unknown. Although there is evidence that neuroinflammation affects the ECM and PNNs in neurological disease models6 and that chronic exercise reduces neuroinflammation in these contexts7, there is scarce research regarding the effect of exercise on neuroinflammation in relation to ECM composition in a healthy model. Chronic exercise generally favours anti-inflammation (7), but research in males suggests that acute exercise may transiently upregulate pro-inflammatory factors in the body8 and brain1, such as MMP-91. MMP-9 also degrades the ECM9. Accordingly, for my MSc, I will investigate the possible interactions between neuroinflammation (e.g., MMP-9, cytokines) and ECM composition during acute and chronic exercise in adult mice of both sexes and correlate these changes with memory outcomes. \r\n\r\nSpecific Aims: 1. To investigate the sex-specific mechanisms of acute versus chronic aerobic exercise on neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. 2. To determine if there is a relationship between these anticipated neurobiological changes with spatial and recognition memory outcomes in young healthy adult model. \r\n\r\nMethods: Adult female and male C57BL6\/J mice will be assigned to either an acute or a chronic exercise intervention. The mice in the acute intervention will be divided into a sedentary group or a group undergoing one single 2-hour bout of moderate intensity treadmill exercise. A subset of mice (n=10 per sex per group) will be euthanized two hours after exercise. Another set (n=10 per sex per group) will perform the Novel Object Location Task (NOLT) and Novel Object Recognition Task (NORT) two hours after exercise and will be euthanized 24 hours post-exercise. The chronic intervention mice (n=10 per sex per group) will either be treadmill exercised for one hour per day, five days per week for eight weeks, or remain sedentary for the same time, as I have done previously6. During the final week of the chronic exercise intervention, metabolic cages will be used to examine locomotor activity, food and water intake patterns, and oxygen consumption. Forty-eight hours after the last exercise training bout, mice will perform the NOLT and NORT, with euthanasia 24 hours later. All mice will be euthanized at 18 weeks of age. The hippocampus will be dissected out of both hemispheres, snap frozen, and stored at -80°C. Western blot analysis will be used to examine the protein content of the ECM (aggrecan, brevican, tenascin link proteins), MMP-9, and cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1b, IL-10). Blood samples will be collected via cardiac puncture to measure inflammatory markers via ELISA. Data will be analysed using two-way ANOVA (sex and exercise as factors) and associations between brain markers and memory will be explored using correlations. \r\n\r\nHypotheses: \r\nAcute exercise will upregulate inflammatory cytokines and MMP-9 in the hippocampus in both sexes, however, inflammatory cytokine profiles will differ between the sexes. This acute inflammatory response will not be conserved with the adoption of a chronic exercise regimen, which will promote greater anti-inflammation. Alterations in ECM content will not be detected with acute exercise, but ECM proteins will be lower with the chronic intervention. Memory will be enhanced in both sexes and with both exercise interventions, however females will demonstrate enhanced cognitive benefit from the chronic exercise regime compared to chronically exercised males. \r\n\r\nPotential Impact: \r\nThis will be the first study to examine the effect of acute vs chronic exercise on the relationship between inflammation and ECM content with respect to learning and memory in both sexes. Results will highlight sex differences and the role of exercise-induced inflammation with respect to plasticity and memory, as well as potential therapeutic targets that may mimic the regulatory effects of exercise. Finally, sex differences with respect to neurocognitive outcomes will glean new insights into the optimal type of exercise prescription based on sex.","Exercise is widely accepted as a positive health behaviour, but its benefits are often touted in the context of aesthetics over health. My research seeks to demonstrate how exercise remodels the brain, and how this remodeling may lead to positive changes in cognition and behaviour. I look at inflammation and plasticity within the brains of mice that are exercising compared to mice that are inactive. I use memory tasks to determine if exercise-induced neurobiological changes are related to changes in cognition. This work will glean insight into the therapeutic processes of exercise and yield benefits in understanding activity-specific exercise prescription.",,"Exercise, Chronic, Acute, Sex, Inflammatory, Memory",n/a,n,Inflammation,Exercise ,,Animal,,Mind and Body,Brock University,2024,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleine-maheu-07b121293/,,,Brock Univeristy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Faeez (Muhammad) Ansari,,Richa Pandey,Universal TV Remote for Dementia Patients,"Dementia is a common and significant diagnosis found in the elderly population, and yet dementia technology items are often poorly designed and of low quality. For many seniors, the TV is a source of comfort and connection to the world. The remotes that come with TV setups have a hundred buttons and for someone with dementia, they are nearly impossible to use. Dementia remotes do exist, but their design is still flawed and far from user-friendly. There is too much range within the channel and volume options, and the UI does not represent the simplest form. We have received a personal anecdote from a University of Calgary Professor that upholds the claims made above, and the goal of this project is to make an easy-to-use, robust, TV remote that aims to reduce the struggles dementia patients (and their caretakers) experience. In more detail, the remote will have 5 buttons: power, channel up, channel down, volume up, and volume down. Each button will also be illuminated with an LED as it is pressed. The remote will be universal and can be programmed to work identically to a remote that the user already owns. This is done by having an IR receiver that can characterize the signals sent from the original remote and assign the same signals to the corresponding buttons. The remote will also have the option to limit volume and channel ranges, this functionality will be available to the user through a web application and the remote will be programmed via a micro-USB cable. In future iterations of the project, the goal would be to improve battery life and give the device the ability to wirelessly communicate with the web application.",,,,,,,,,,,Personalized Treatment,University of Calgary,2024,2341.86,2341.86,,,,,,,"2,341.86","2,341.86",Impact,Impact,,,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meZhDMcAAAAJ&hl,https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-ansari-b93126244/?originalSubdomain=ca,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad-Ansari-66,,University of Calgary,ConocoPhillips,,,muhammad.ansari1@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Camille (Cami) Eamon,,Tyler Cluff,Robotic Assessment of Impairments in Learning from Visual or Proprioceptive Feedback in Adult Stroke Survivors,"Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Canada and across the globe1-3. Population growth, an aging population, and lifestyle factors have led to an increase in the prevalence of stroke in Canada3. Advances in acute stroke care (clot-busting drugs, endovascular therapy) have saved lives and reduced stroke morbidity4. However, as many as 70% of stroke survivors have motor impairments5 that compromise the ability to perform arm movements, jeopardize their autonomy, detract from quality of life and impose a burden on the health care system.\r\n\r\nOnce acute care is complete, rehabilitation is often the only option to regain motor function and independence. Stroke rehabilitation involves working with a team of therapists and caregivers to improve movement through intensive practice. It is a time, effort, and resource-intensive process that aims to engage neuroplasticity, promote tissue repair, and facilitate recovery6. Therapy is often unsuccessful, and many people are left with impairments that impede autonomy and detract from quality of life.\r\n\r\nTherapy assumes that participants can use sensory feedback to promote the recovery of arm movements through motor learning6,7,8. It is common for therapists to use visual or proprioceptive feedback to support the relearning of arm movements9,10. Growing evidence, however, suggests that impairments in using visual or proprioceptive feedback to learn and improve arm movements are common after stroke11-18. This raises the question of whether unique impairments in motor learning affect an individual’s response to specific types of therapy.\r\n\r\nTherapists have tools to measure motor function and use this information to plan and deliver care. They lack objective tools, however, to understand if a participant has the motor learning ability to respond to therapy, promote recovery, and improve arm function19,20. Decisions surrounding the delivery of care rely on a trial-and-error process that is time and resource-intensive. Objective measures of motor learning may provide therapists with an evidence-base to guide clinical decisions and personalize care based on the needs of individual stroke survivors. The aim of my project is to develop robotic tests to assess and identify different types of motor learning impairments in stroke survivors. \r\n\r\nPrimary Research Question: Do adult stroke survivors display selective impairments in learning from visual or proprioceptive feedback during the early phases of stroke recovery? \r\n\r\nObjectives: Develop robotic tasks to assess and identify individual impairments in learning upper limb movements from visual and proprioceptive feedback during the early subacute phase of recovery (&lt;21 days post-stroke). This will allow us to identify individual impairments in learning from visual and\/or proprioceptive feedback. Secondary analyses will examine if learning from each type of feedback correlates with common clinical measures of motor function in the arm. \r\n\r\nHypotheses: Individual stroke survivors will display independent impairments in learning from visual and proprioceptive feedback. Clinical assessments and motor learning will not correlate strongly, indicating that clinical assessments are inadequate for capturing impairments in motor learning.\r\n\r\nParticipants: 80 participants with stroke will be recruited from the Foothills Medical Centre and Dr. Vernon Fanning Centre in Calgary, AB, Canada. Inclusion criteria are: 18 years or older with clinical diagnosis of first-time, unilateral stroke within 21 days of stroke (i.e., early subacute phase). Exclusion criteria are: history of previous stroke, prior diagnosis of secondary neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease), musculoskeletal injuries that could interfere with upper limb range of motion, apraxia and\/or visual neglect as identified by clinical assessment21,22, or the inability to understand task instructions. 80 controls will be recruited from the Calgary area. They will meet inclusion criteria if they are 18 years or older and have no known history of neurological conditions or significant upper limb injuries affecting movement. This will be the largest and most comprehensive assessment of motor learning impairments in adult stroke survivors.\r\n\r\nRobotic Assessments: We will compare the ways in which participants with stroke and healthy controls adapt their reaching movements when exposed to novel visual and force disturbances. Participants will perform planar reaching movements to virtual targets in a Kinarm exoskeleton. The controls will complete the tasks with their dominant (n = 40) or non-dominant arm (n = 40). Participants with stroke will complete the tasks with their impaired arm (dominant or non-dominant). This will allow us to determine whether the side of the stroke-affected arm influences motor learning in stroke survivors.\r\nParticipants will perform a visuomotor adaptation (VMA) task to examine their capacity to learn from visual feedback. The VMA task will impose a rotation that creates a systematic discrepancy between the participant’s hand movements and a feedback cursor displayed in their workspace. They will also perform a force adaptation (FA) task to examine their capacity to learn from proprioceptive feedback. The FA task will apply forces that displace the participant’s hand lateral to the direction of the reach. Motor adaptation will be quantified as the initial reaching direction for the VMA task and peak lateral reaching deviation for the FA task. Stroke survivors who adapt less than the 5th percentile of controls will be considered impaired in that task. Independence tests and machine learning algorithms will be used to determine whether there is a relationship between impairments in learning from visual and proprioceptive feedback. Correlation analyses will assess whether relationships exist between VMA and FA performance for all participants. \r\n\r\nRelationship Between Motor Learning and Clinical Outcomes: We will assess motor function using standardized clinical scales23-30. Correlation analyses will be used to examine relationships between performance in motor learning tasks and clinical outcomes. This will allow us to assess whether current clinical assessments are sufficient for capturing motor learning abilities.\r\n\r\nSignificance: Understanding the range and severity of individual impairments and their relationship with clinical outcomes may save time and resources by allowing therapists to determine which individuals are likely to be more responsive to different therapy strategies. This may allow therapists to personalize rehabilitation by leveraging intact motor learning mechanisms or targeting impairments. In the long term, this approach may allow therapists to improve recovery for individual patients, reduce the burden of motor impairments, loss of autonomy, and promote a return to daily life.","Stroke survivors often participate in rehabilitation to relearn arm movements needed for daily life. Therapy assumes that individuals can learn from errors and feedback when repeating a movement by a process called motor learning. However, therapists lack objective tools to understand if a participant has the motor learning ability to respond to therapy. They must instead use a trial- and-error process to determine which strategies work for each individual. I will profile individual motor learning impairments in stroke survivors using robotic assessments. This information may allow therapists to tailor care to individual learning needs and better promote recovery for each patient.",,"Motor, Learning, Impairments, Feedback, Proprioceptive","""Learning Impairments, Stroke""",y,"Error Correction, Motor Learning",Visual and proprioceptive feedback,Recovery,Human,,"Personalized Treatment, Tech",University of Calgary,2024,"22,000.00","13,200.00",,,,,,,"13,200.00","22,000.00","Masters, Graduate",Graduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cami-eamon-174383201/,,,University of Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daniela Carbajal Velez,,Darlene Auger,Bridging Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science: Understanding the Neuroscience of Wiwip'son Indigenous Healing,"The Wîwîp'son Animation Project aims to create a compelling scientific visualization that bridges Indigenous healing wisdom with modern neuroscience, explaining how the traditional Nehiyaw (Cree) healing swing ceremony impacts neurological health through rhythmic movement, mindful practice, and ceremonial elements. This innovative project will produce a high- quality animated segment for inclusion in a documentary about the Wîwîp'son ceremony, using accessible scientific visualization techniques to demonstrate the neurological mechanisms activated during the healing swing practice, including vestibular stimulation, nervous system regulation, and mind-body integration. Working with professional animators and scientific illustrators, the project will create engaging visuals that respectfully represent both the ceremonial aspects and the underlying neuroscience, focusing on key areas such as vestibular system activation through rhythmic movement, nervous system regulation and stress response, brain-body connection during ceremonial practice, and neuroplasticity and healing pathways. This project represents a unique opportunity to make complex neuroscience concepts accessible to diverse audiences, document the scientific basis of traditional healing practices, bridge Indigenous and Western scientific knowledge systems, and create educational resources for both Indigenous communities and healthcare providers. The animation will serve multiple purposes, including as an educational tool for communities and healthcare providers, documentation of traditional healing mechanisms, a resource for future research and understanding, and a bridge between traditional wisdom and contemporary science. Led by Dr. Darlene Auger, an Indigenous wellness expert with extensive experience in the Wîwîp'son ceremony, this project brings together traditional knowledge and scientific expertise, with the resulting animation contributing to broader understanding of how traditional Indigenous healing practices impact neurological health and wellness. The $5,000 grant will support professional animation services, scientific consultation and accuracy review, cultural consultation to ensure respectful representation, and technical production and post-production work. This initiative represents an important step in documenting and sharing the scientific understanding of Indigenous healing practices while maintaining cultural integrity and respect for traditional knowledge. The Wîwîp'son Animation Project will be completed over a six-month period, with the timeline structured as follows: Months 1-2 will be dedicated to the pre- production phase, which includes script development, scientific consultation, and storyboarding. Months 3-4 will focus on animation production, encompassing scientific visualization development and initial rendering. Month 5 will involve a thorough review process with cultural advisors and scientific experts, followed by necessary revisions based on their feedback. The final month, Month 6, will be devoted to final production tasks, including sound design, rendering, and delivery of the completed animation. Upon completion, the animation will be integrated into the documentary, with the final delivery scheduled for Fall 2025. This comprehensive timeline ensures a thorough and collaborative approach to creating an accurate and culturally respectful scientific visualization of the Wîwîp'son ceremony. The $5,127 budget for the Wîwîp'son Animation Project has been carefully allocated to create a high-quality scientific visualization that explains the neurological impacts of this traditional healing practice. A quote for $8,362 has been secured for the full development of an animated video. However, ReadyUp Productions, currently producing the Wiwipson documentary, has many of the assets needed for a 3-minute animated video as part of that work, reducing the cost to produce the Wîwîp'son Animation Project. By leveraging these assets and industry connections, this project will use the budget to share the story of Wîwîp'son, its cultural and scientific significance, and highlight Branch Out's role in supporting this research. The budget allocation includes pre- production components, core animation production, post-production elements, and consultation services. For pre- production, $500 is allocated for script development and scientific consultation to ensure accurate translation of complex neurological concepts into accessible visual narratives, while $700 is set aside for the storyboard artist fee. The core animation production receives the largest allocation, with $2,000 for scientific visualization and animation work, $400 for character and environment design, and $400 for motion graphics. Post-production elements include $300 for sound design and music, and $400 for final rendering and editing. Consultation services comprise $150 each for cultural advisor review and scientific accuracy review. This careful allocation of resources supports the project's goals of creating engaging scientific visualizations of traditional healing practices, ensuring cultural and scientific accuracy, producing professional-quality educational content, and building bridges between Indigenous and Western scientific knowledge systems, ultimately resulting in an impactful educational tool serving both Indigenous communities and the broader scientific community.",,,,N/A,y,"Vestibular system activations, nervous system regulation, stress response",Educational Resource,"Healing, Bridging Indigenous and Wester scientific knowledge systems",Human,N/A,Mind and Body,University of Alberta,2025,5000,5000,,,,,,,"5,000.00","5,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,,,,,University of Alberta,,,,dcarbaja@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jonah Rivette,,Dave (David) Collins ,An exploration of what transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation stimulates.,"Background and Rationale: A spinal cord injury (SCI) can limit voluntary control of one's muscles, leading to paralysis and debilitating secondary complications. Recently, researchers have made a concerted effort to explore the rehabilitative potential of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) for people experiencing paralysis. tSCS is a non-invasive method of stimulating the human spinal cord. During tSCS, pulses of electrical stimulation are delivered over the spinal cord, through the skin of the back, which can help restore voluntary control of muscles. tSCS is thought to target sensory nerves where they enter the spinal cord (i.e. the “dorsal roots”), however, preliminary data from our lab suggests that tSCS not only activates sensory nerves in the dorsal roots of the spinal cord but also sensory nerves in the skin and muscle of the back. We propose that when tSCS activates the dorsal roots it “excites” motor neurons in the spinal cord and produces stronger contractions (excitation), while activation of sensory nerves in skin and muscles of the back “inhibit” motor neurons in the spinal cord and decrease muscle contraction amplitude (inhibition). The effect of activating sensory nerves in the back during tSCS is rarely considered and has important implications about how this technique exerts its effects. Objectives: To determine what neural structures are activated by tSCS. Hypotheses: 1) When tSCS is applied through the skin over the spinal cord, responses in leg muscles will show both excitation and inhibition, because sensory nerves in the back AND dorsal roots will be activated. 2) When tSCS is applied through the skin ten centimeters to the left of the spinal cord, muscle responses will show only inhibition, because only non dorsal root sensory nerves in the back will be activated. 3) When tSCS is applied through ANESTHETISED skin over the spinal cord, muscle responses will show only excitation, because only sensory nerves in the dorsal roots will be activated as sensory nerves in the skin will be blocked. 4) When tSCS is applied through ANESTHETISED skin ten centimeters to the left of the spinal cord, there will be no muscle responses, because neither sensory nerves in the back or dorsal roots will be activated. Methodology: 15 participants with no history of neuromuscular disease/injury will be recruited to take part in one, approximately 2.5 hour session. Each participant will perform two-three maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of plantar flexion (gas pedal motion at ankle). tSCS pulses will be delivered over the spinal cord (at the midline of the back) to determine the lowest intensity (threshold) that elicits a soleus response. For each trial, participants will receive 100 pulses of tSCS while holding a plantar flexion contraction of 10-20% MVC. Initially four trials will be conducted and each will involve either tSCS being delivered over the spinal cord (i.e midline), or ten centimetres to the left of the spinal cord, at an intensity of 70% or 100% of threshold in separate trials. We will then apply a lidocaine anesthetic cream to the skin of the back of each participant for 45 minutes to block sensory nerves in the skin and muscle of the back. The initial four trials will be repeated. All trials will be done in random order. Data will be collected using LabVIEW software at a sampling frequency of 5000 Hz. Electromyography (EMG) data will be recorded from the soleus muscle. Responses in the soleus will be measured as areas of EMG that exceed two standard  deviation bands from the mean of the background muscle activity. Analysis of the data will be done post-hoc using MATLAB software. Statistical analysis of group data will include a repeated measure analysis of variance. Additionally, statistical significance will be evaluated using an α level of p ≤ 0.05. If appropriate, a Tukey’s HSD test will be performed post-hoc. Potential Impact: If our hypotheses are supported, it will show that tSCS activates not only sensory nerves in the dorsal roots to boost muscle contractions, but also sensory nerves in the skin and muscle to inhibit muscle contractions. Further knowledge of the effects of tSCS on muscles of the legs will help us determine how it can be best utilized for people experiencing paralysis. For example, delivering tSCS to only inhibit contractions may help reduce spasticity while delivering tSCS to activate the dorsal roots and boost contractions might restore voluntary movements.","Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has gained considerable interest in the past several years as a non-invasive treatment to help produce movement for people with spinal cord injuries. It involves using surface electrodes on the skin of the back to activate spinal nerves responsible for controlling muscles. In this way, it is thought to “boost” voluntary contractions. However, little is known about the exact structures activated by tSCS. Our research aims to determine what is activated by tSCS, and when. This may help determine how tSCS should be administered to maximize its efficacy in facilitating movement for people experiencing various forms of paralysis.",,"tcsc, Cord, Spinal, Nerves, Sensory",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Sensory Nerves,tSCS,"Mobility, Rehabilitation",Human,,Tech,University of Alberta,2025,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-rivette-472094353/,,https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dcollins/index.html,University of Alberta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nishaad Sheth,,Davide Martino,Effectiveness and feasibility of multi-focal transcranial low-intensity ultrasound stimulation in Parkinson's Disease: a randomized sham-controlled trial,"Context: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder with no curative therapies. Upper- limb tremor, a common symptom of PD, can be debilitating, causing significant mental and physical stress (1). Current treatments include symptom-managing medications, or an invasive surgery that is not appropriate for the majority of PD patients, who are elderly. Neuromodulation offers an innovative alternative by directly altering neural activity without damaging brain tissue (2). Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has emerged as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique, uniquely capable of reaching deep targets with high precision; however, its clinical applicability is not well studied (3). Rationale: LIFU has demonstrated the ability to reliably exert inhibitory effects on brain structures which control motor output (4). An open-label, uncontrolled study conducted by the Focused Ultrasound Program in Calgary has applied a personalized procedure to select and administer one of two different sonication strategies targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus in 7 people with essential tremor and 5 with PD. Focused ultrasound sonication led to an overall 84% mean reduction in tremor power, with clinically meaningful changes observed in the PD group (mean reduction: 68%; median reduction: 96.3%). We hypothesize that our novel LIFU protocol will significantly reduce the tremor severity of PD patients compared to the sham-control protocol. Objectives: I) We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multifocal LIFU protocol for suppressing tremor in PD patients. II) Assess how micro-adjustments in targeting influence tremor severity. III) Evaluate the safety, feasibility and scalability of LIFU as a potential therapy. Methods: I will collaborate with UCalgary’s Focused Ultrasound team to conduct a crossover randomized control trial with 20 PD patients with tremor. Participants will first undergo an MRI scan to map the VIM using tractography, which will be used with an open-source application (BabelBrain) to model the multifocal LIFU targeting (5). LIFU will be applied to exert inhibitory effects on the VIM and 6 adjacent areas (5 mm outward), with each area receiving 30–120 seconds of sonication. Tremor severity will be measured with a triaxial accelerometer at baseline (before sonication), immediately after, and at intervals of, 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-LIFU for each sonication. The primary outcome are changes in tremor severity (as measured with accelerometry) immediately before and 5 minutes after LIFU sonications. Secondary outcomes include changes in tremor severity at the other post-sonication intervals. To control for confounders such as placebo effects, patients will undergo a sham protocol one week apart, randomized and blinded to the researcher conducting the study visit. Lastly, we will implement a novel, secondary assessment of tr mor severity at four points throughout study visits. This computer program (developed as part of my undergraduate thesis) utilizes drawing tablets to quantify tremor severity via a digital Archimedes spiral test. Its measurements will be compared to the accelerometer, the current gold standard. Potential Impact: LIFU is a recent technology with great potential in the future treatment of PD, however, no group has yet demonstrated a clinical benefit of LIFU. This randomized control trial is the next step of LIFU research, as doing so contributes pragmatic evidence on the therapeutic potential of LIFU. By stimulating the VIM and adjacent brain areas, we will gain a greater understanding of the effectiveness of LIFU targeting techniques and evaluate a personalized approach to sonication, as each individual will eventually undergo sonication at the more efficient of two predefined sonication strategies (as determined in the first half of the protocol). Additionally, we aim to validate the drawing tablet program’s accuracy and feasibility as a clinical tool. Inclusion of this innovation will help the development of alternate, digital means for tremor testing. Precise, non-invasive modulation techniques are the future of non-pharmacological neurological treatment. With PD’s high prevalence in Canada, placing long term strain on our communities and healthcare systems, the significance of this study cannot be understated. This research may contribute essential evidence for the translation of LIFU into clinical practice.","Upwards of 100 000 Canadians suffer from Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative brain disease with no cure or preventative measures. Current medical treatments for managing the disease do not stop its progression and can cause debilitating side effects. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is an innovative technology that can influence how structures in the brain send signals and communicate with your body, without involving surgery or damaging brain tissue. Our project aims to apply this technology with Parkinson’s disease patients, to determine if it can be used to treat one of the major symptoms: tremor. This research is key for the further development of LIFU as a safe, accessible treatment for Parkinson’s disease.

Alessia Apa,,Isabelle Aubert,Evaluating the mechanisms underlying FUS-mediated oligodendrogenesis ,"Background. Oligodendrocytes, the predominant cell type in the brain’s white matter, are responsible for producing myelin. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter abnormalities occur alongside the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles(1–4). Recognizing the importance of oligodendrocytes to myelin integrity, our goal is to develop therapeutic interventions to support their proliferation and maturation. Rationale. Focused ultrasound (FUS) guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique used to deliver acoustic energy to specific brain regions. FUS combined with an intravenous (i.v) injection of lipid-coated microbubbles (MB) can be used at acoustic pressures known to transiently modulate the BBB without damaging tissue(5,6). Our promising pilot data demonstrates that FUS with MB, leading to BBB modulation, stimulates hippocampal oligodendrogenesis. Specifically, in C57BL/6J mice, a single FUS application to the hippocampus combined with MB resulted in a 6.8-fold and 2.3-fold increase in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), 1- and 4-days post treatment, respectively. 30 days later, the number of mature oligodendrocytes was increased by 5.3-fold. In the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, FUS with MB led to a trending increase in newborn OPCs in the targeted hippocampus at 7 days, and significantly increased immature and mature oligodendrocytes at 30 days post-treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to address whether BBB modulation, achieved by the presence of MB in FUS treatments, is necessary for generating oligodendrogenesis. Hypothesis. BBB-modulation, achieved by the combination of FUS and MB, is required for FUS-mediated oligodendrogenesis to occur. Aim 1: Evaluate the necessity of BBB modulation to promote oligodendrogenesis. In TgCRND8 mice, FUS will be applied at 0.6 MPa, a pressure known to modulate the BBB with MB without damage to the brain(7,8), in two cohorts: one receiving MB and the other not. Based on past work on FUS-mediated neurogenesis(9), we expect oligodendrogenesis to occur only when the BBB is modulated by FUS in presence of MB. Aim 2: Determine the effect of pressure on FUS-mediated oligodendrogenesis with BBB modulation. We will compare the efficacy of FUS-BBB modulation on oligodendrogenesis when applied at 0.6 MPa and 0.4 MPa pressures capable of modulating the BBB when combined with MB. We expect that as long as FUS results in BBB modulation, regardless of the pressure, oligodendrogenesis will increase. Methods. For aim 1, FUS will be unilaterally directed to the hippocampus and frontal cortex of adult TgCRND8 mice and non transgenic (nTg) littermates at an acoustic pressure of 0.6 MPa: half of the animals in each group will receive i.v.-injected MB and the other, saline. For aim 2, in separate cohorts of TgCRND8 mice and nTg littermates, comparisons will be made between FUS applied at 0.6 MPa and 0.4 MPa (both with MB). In both aims, the untreated contralateral hippocampus will serve as an internal negative control. Immediately following FUS, T1 weighted images will unveil the permeability of the BBB, while T2-star images will indicate any potential microhemorrhage. BrdU will be administered from 1 day to 4 days post-FUS, based on our previous studies identifying this highly cell-proliferative time window(10). Animals will be euthanized at 7- or 30-days post FUS to evaluate the proliferation of OPCs and the maturation of newborn oligodendrocytes, respectively. Tissue processing and analysis. Mice will be intracardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde before brains are extracted and sectioned horizontally. Immunohistochemistry will be done with DAPI and antibodies against markers of cell proliferation (Ki67,BrdU), oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Olig2), OPCs (NG2, PDGFRα), and mature oligodendrocytes (TPPP) (11). Images will be taken with a Leica Stellaris 5 microscope, and quantified using computing pipelines developed in the Aubert Lab(12,13). Significance. The importance of determining the experimental parameters of FUS required for oligodendrogenesis cannot be overstated. The results from this experiment are critical in identifying the FUS parameters that maximize the highest levels of therapeutic efficacy while upholding the importance of safety for clinical translation. If successful, this research has the potential to establish FUS as a promising treatment option for AD and conditions affecting the brain's white matter.","Alzheimer's disease affects both white and grey matter. The predominant cells in white matter, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, which insulates cells in a way that makes their connections stronger and improves communication. White matter deficits can result in a breakdown of cell-to-cell communication. In a preclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease, we have discovered that the effects of ultrasound waves through the skull, a safe, non-surgical and pain-free treatment, can generate new oligodendrocytes that could boost myelin production. With funding, we aim to develop the parameters and efficacy of this ultrasound technology to promote brain health and brain function.

Mariam Belghiti,She/Her,Mark Boulos,Using Cannabis to Treat Restless Legs Syndrome: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Pilot Safety and Feasibility Trial,"Rationale Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes painful and uncomfortable sensations in the legs, and its symptoms have a significant impact on sleep and quality of life. Treatment options such as dopamine agents and alpha-2-delta ligands such as gabapentin are often recommended as first-line therapy, however, these medications can decrease in efficacy over time and patients may also develop augmentation of their symptoms (1). Augmentation in RLS is the progressive worsening of RLS symptoms beyond initial severity in response to dopaminergic treatments, which can leave patients' symptoms unmanaged (2). Moreover, many current treatment options can have unwanted or debilitating side effects such as nausea and dizziness (2). RLS can often be inadequately treated indicating a need for alternative treatment options (3). The analgesic effects of cannabis may be useful for treating the sensory manifestations of RLS (4). Cannabinoid receptors are distributed throughout the pain pathways and found to help with pain disorders (2) Cannabis use has also been reported to reduce dopamine synthesis (5), which may counteract the increased dopamine production seen in RLS (6). There are also sleep-inducing properties of cannabis that may help RLS patients fall asleep (7) Moreover, the side effects of cannabis have been shown to be limited, and are often restricted to high doses of THC (8) Occurrences of adverse events can be limited by starting at lower doses of THC (and not exceeding 20-30 mg/day) and administering THC in conjunction with cannabidiol (CBD) (8). A 1 year safety study looking at medical cannabis found that there was no difference in serious adverse event rates in cannabis users compared to controls (9) However, some common side effects of cannabis use include drowsiness, dry mouth and cognitive issues (8) Recent case reports have indicated that there may be benefits for using cannabis in patients with moderate to severe RLS (10, 11). The patients in these reports suffered from severe RLS symptoms and found limited efficacy from current pharmacological therapies. Patients (N=18 combined) reported self-administering cannabis to treat persistent symptoms, and all but one patient experienced well tolerated relief. In another study that included medical cannabis users with sleep disorders (including RLS), they found that 93% of patients self-reported improvement in sleep quality after 6 weeks (12) The data from these case reports are promising but limited, and a randomized controlled trial investigating the use of cannabis to treat RLS is needed to establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for RLS. Hypotheses We hypothesize that using cannabis to treat RLS will be feasible, as measured by rates of recruitment and study completion, and safe, as measured by the incidence of adverse events. We secondarily hypothesize that cannabis may improve quality of life, RLS symptom severity, objective sleep measures and subjective sleep quality. Methods This pilot study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, parallel group, controlled trial. Cannabis will be administered as an adjunctive therapy; thus, patients will not be required to discontinue their current RLS therapies and changes to these therapies will not be permitted during the trial. We will aim to recruit a sample of 30 participants (15 in each study arm) with moderate-to-severe RLS. Outcomes including questionnaires and home sleep testing will be assessed at baseline and 8-week follow up. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms for 8 weeks: i) CBD:THC oil (‘Cannabis group’), or ii) placebo oil (‘Placebo group’). They will be directly sent the study drug, and there will be a 4-week titration period. Starting at 1mL per night, they will adjust titration each week to a maximum of 8mL per night. Potential Impact If cannabis is found to be feasible and safe for the management of RLS symptoms, the results of this study will be used to design a larger trial that will be adequately powered to determine the efficacy of using cannabis to treat RLS. Cannabis may provide the much-needed relief sought out by patients who are currently suffering from this debilitating condition. Moreover, medical cannabis is a relatively affordable treatment option, which may make it more accessible. Importantly, cannabis may result in fewer or less severe side leading to improved quality of life.","Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes painful and uncomfortable sensations in the legs, and its symptoms have a significant impact on sleep and quality of life. Cannabis has been used by some RLS patients as a treatment due to its painkilling and sedating effects, however, there has never been a clinical research trial investigating cannabis in patients with RLS. We will do this In our study.

David Shizgal,He/Him,Peter Carlen,Minor Phytocannabinoids as a Nonclassical Plant Based Epilepsy Treatment to better Combat Treatment Resistant Epilepsy.,"This project will be conducted to explore the use of minor phytocannabinoids Cannabichromene (CBC) and Cannabigerol (CBG) as anticonvulsants. The goal of this project is to reduce duration, frequency, intensity and onset of seizures induced in vitro in the cortex layer of mouse brain slices. Although established treatments and drugs for epilepsy exist, 30-40% of epilepsy patients are non responsive to them and these individuals require the greatest amount of care and resources [3]. In addition, these treatments are accompanied by adverse side effects [4]. There is a good deal of literature pointing towards the efficacy of Cannabidiol (CBD) as an anticonvulsant, specifically in those with treatment resistant epilepsy [1,6]. However, there is yet to be serious exploration on the effects of minor phytocannabinoids and their ability to act as anticonvulsants possibly leading to additional, alternative or more effective mechanisms than CBD. It has been demonstrated that CBD in combination with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is more effective than either of these cannabinoids alone [1,2]. However, THC has psychedelic effects which can be undesirable. The exploration of the minor phytocannabinoids could yield similar effects without the psychedelic effect. If effective, these cannabinoids could provide additional non-classic nutraceutical anticonvulsant treatments which could prove essential in treating patients with treatment resistant epilepsy and serve as a personalized treatment to those unresponsive to conventional treatment. Therefore, based on previous research conducted on cannabinoids, it is hypothesized that concentrations of CBG and CBC administered at doses of 10, 30 and 100 micromolar and in combination with varying ratios of CBD will reduce duration, frequency and onset of seizures induced in vitro in the cortex layer of mouse brain slices. The experiments will be conducted on juvenile C57BL/6 Mice. Mice will be chosen because of their small brain size helping to insure that connectivity between neurons will stay intact during the preparation of brain slices. They will be juvenile because of a greater tendency to develop seizures [5,7]. The mice will be anesthetized and then sacrificed. The brain will be removed and a vibratome will be used to cut 500 micron thick cortical slices. The slices will then be incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) before recordings. During recording, slices will be submerged and perfused with aerated ACSF. Local field potentials will be recorded using a glass electrode filled with ACSF. The seizures will be induced using the convulsant, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) which blocks potassium ion channels, therefore causing depolarization and prolonged glutamate release leading to epileptiform activity. 4-AP will be dissolved in ACSF for a final concentration of 100 micromolar. During recording, the initial 10 minutes will be used to establish baseline. The slice will be then washed with 4-AP for 45 minutes, followed by a 45 minute wash (or no wash for a control) of either 10, 30 or 100 micromolars of CBC or CBG. A variation of the trials will be conducted in which the cortical slices will initially be submerged and perfused in ACSF containing the cannabinoid (at the same previously stated concentrations) to explore preventative and pharmacokinetic aspects. This pretreatment variation may require lower concentrations for efficacy and is a better representation of clinical conditions where patients take anticonvulsants to prevent seizures, and not after seizures. PClamp will be used as the recording software. The quantitative data produced will be used to analyze the amplitude (in mV), frequency (in seconds), onset (in seconds) and duration (in seconds) of the seizure like events (SLE) through the pClamp software and MATLAB. Seizure like events will be defined as excitable activity with a duration greater than 5 seconds. The amplitude of the event will be defined as the difference between the highest and lowest point of the SLE. As stated in the methods, the outcome measure will be the amplitude, frequency, duration and onset of the SLE's. These outcome measures will allow for assessment of CBG's and CBC's effectiveness as anticonvulsants. The potential impact of this project is the implementation of plant based non-classical potential anticonvulsants as a means to treat and respond to epilepsy, most importantly for those who may not be responsive to classical treatments.","There is a good percentage of patients with epilepsy for whom the generic treatments are ineffective. This project aims to take a nonclassical treatment approach to epilepsy in order to address the percentage of those with who cannot be treated by conventional means. It will focus on using the compounds in cannabis that do not elicit a high to address the frequency, duration, intensity and onset time of seizures. It has already been found that a couple of the compounds in cannabis are able treat epilepsy. Those compounds work better in tandem but one of them causes a high, however, there are many more compounds in cannabis that have yet to be explored that could prove to be more effective while avoiding the high produced.

Alexandra Wasti,,Robin Green,Optimizing Slow-Paced Breathing Parameters for Cognition and Mental Health in Concussion,"Background: Up to 50% of the 200,000 Canadians who sustain concussions annually experience prolonged cognitive symptoms1–3, including impairments in memory, executive function, and attention, alongside mental health issues such as depression and anxiety3. These challenges often impede their ability to resume essential roles in education, work, sports, and caregiving, leading to diminished quality of life. Despite the widespread impact, effective treatments remain scarce4. Slow paced breathing (SPB), defined as a rate of 10 breaths per minute or fewer5, has recently emerged as a promising intervention to enhance cognitive function6 by increasing Heart Rate Variability (HRV)7. HRV, the variation in time between heartbeats, is associated with improved cerebral blood flow8, a mechanism thought to underlie cognitive enhancement. An ongoing systematic review I am currently working on9 highlights SPB’s efficacy in improving cognitive domains such as learning, memory, and executive functions10,11, with additional evidence supporting its benefits for depression and anxiety12. However, optimal SPB parameters, such as the most effective inhale-to exhale ratio, remain undefined, and this intervention has not yet been studied in concussion populations. Objectives: The proposed study will employ a mixed-design three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) design—including an active control group, a group practicing SPB with an equal inhale-to exhale ratio, and a group utilizing SPB with a shorter inhale-to exhale ratio—to evaluate the cognitive and mental health effects of SPB in adults with concussions who experience persistent symptoms. By addressing a critical gap in current treatment options, the results of this research could establish SPB as a targeted, evidence-based intervention for this population. Hypothesis 1: Participants in both SPB groups are expected to demonstrate significant improvements in cognitive and mental health outcomes compared to the active control group. Hypothesis 2: Given previous literature demonstrating the ability of longer exhales to improve HRV13, participants in the shorter inhale-to-exhale SPB group are expected to exhibit greater improvements in cognitive and mental health outcomes than those in the equal inhale-to-exhale SPB group. Methods: Sixty patients with a clinical diagnosis of a concussion, persisting cognitive and mental health symptoms for at least three months, and no prior diagnosed mental health disorders will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms (n = 20 participants per arm). The intervention groups will perform either an equal inhale-to-exhale ratio SPB or a shorter inhale-to-exhale ratio SPB, while the control group will listen to a classical music playlist. Before the intervention, baseline cognitive outcomes will be measured using the List Sorting Working Memory Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test from the NIH Toolbox14, along with the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading to assess pre-morbid IQ15. Additionally, baseline mental health outcomes will be evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-916 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scales17, selected based on evidence-based recommendations from the Living Concussion Guidelines18. Participants will engage in their designated interventions for 15 minutes each day over 30 days. Short-term effects will be assessed immediately after the first intervention session, with follow-up testing conducted at the end of the 30-day intervention period. Analysis: A two-way mixed-design ANOVA will be used to analyze cognitive and mental health outcomes, accounting for baseline differences. The analysis will determine (1) whether SPB interventions improve cognitive and mental health outcomes, (2) which SPB intervention results in the greatest improvement, and (3) whether further improvements occur after 30 days of practice. Results will inform the design of a larger scale RCT by providing effect size estimates and refining intervention protocols. Significance: The proposed research addresses the critical need for effective concussion treatments, particularly for individuals with persistent symptoms. By advancing SPB as a scalable, evidence-based intervention, this study has the potential to improve long-term cognitive and mental health outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals with acquired brain injuries.","The study is designed to further our understanding of the impact of Slow-Paced Breathing (SPB) to benefit patients with prolonged symptoms of concussion, which is a growing public health concern. If the study is successful, we will have developed an evidence-based, highly accessible, no-cost intervention for ameliorating cognitive symptoms in this population. The intervention protocol will be disseminated as widely as possible, not only in academic settings, but also in contexts with high visibility for patients, such as the Brain Injury Canada website. The proposed research addresses the critical need for effective concussion treatments, particularly for individuals with persistent symptoms.

Mariam Alshaikh,,Sarah Childs,Impact of Endurance Swim Training on Brain Blood Vessel Development,"Context: In adult vertebrates, exercise and endurance training induce physiological, metabolic, and molecular adaptations that enhance performance and prevent brain degenerative diseases (Fiaz, 2014). These occur through changes to the blood vascular system, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the brain. We study cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Common genetic variants in ~20% of the population near the FOXF2 gene lead to elevated risk of CSVD and stroke, with symptoms typically first seen in the elderly, although can occur in people in their 20’s by MRI imaging (Sargurupremraj, 2020). Using the zebrafish models of loss of FOXF2, we detect changes to brain vessels at embryonic and larval stages in mutants, suggesting that this is a lifespan disease that would allow early interventions to prevent brain vessel defects and stroke. In this project I test how blood vessels in animals with a genetic risk for CSVD are changed by exercise endurance training. The blood vessel lining, or endothelium, senses blood flow forces, relaxing vessels to accommodate increased flow during acute exercise. Over time, exercise strengthens blood vessels, improving elasticity and wall structure. Beneath the endothelium, mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) can contract and relax to control blood flow and produce extracellular matrix to reinforce vessel walls, preventing hemorrhage and supporting neurons, thus overall brain health. Rationale: Genetic variants near the FOXF2 gene are strongly linked to CSVD in humans (Chauhan, 2016). In zebrafish, FOXF2 is essential for brain pericyte differentiation and mutants have reduced pericyte coverage that compromises brain vessel integrity (Ryu, 2022). Zebrafish develop rapidly and transgenic lines allow us to image endothelial cells and pericytes in living animals. Zebrafish are free-swimming at 5 days post fertilization (dpf), and swim training can take place from this point forward, allowing us to test the effects of endurance exercise on very early developing animals (equivalent to childhood in humans) to see if this alters brain vessels in this disease model. Hypothesis: Increased blood flow arising from swimming will accelerate development of pericytes in the brains of larval zebrafish in order to increase vascular stability. Exercise will rescue the reduced number of pericytes in mutants, decreasing CSVD. Methodology: Aim 1: Determine vascular network changes after swim training. According to a protocol developed inour lab, wildtype and FOXF2 mutant zebrafish will undergo daily swim training at a current of 8 cm/s from 9-15 days post fertilization inside a specialized swim tunnel (equivalent to a treadmill). The length of time for training increases with age as the animals adapt, training for 1hr/day at 9-10 dpf, 2hr/day at 11 12 dpf, and 3hr/day at 13-15 dpf. Animals will be imaged to visualize endothelial cells using the kdrl:mCherry transgene. From the imaging data, the endothelial pattern will be analyzed (vascular network length, vessel diameters) using VesselMetrics, an in-house Python program. Data will be statistically analyzed using Anova and post-hoc tests using GraphPad Prism for all experiments in this project. Aim 2: Determine changes to pericytes after swim training. Swim training will occur as in Aim 1, using transgenes for pericytes (pdgfrB:GFP) crossed to wildytpe or foxf2a genetic mutants. Pericyte number, transgene intensity, and morphology will be analyzed using computational imaging approaches. Preliminary data in wildtype animals shows a dramatic increase in pericyte intensity in wildtype exercised larvae suggesting that exercise has profound effects on the developing cerebrovasculature. Aim 3: Determine the molecular mechanisms of exercise effects on cerebral vasculature. Preliminary data shows strong upregulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor Pdgfrβ in exercised fish. I will quantitate the levels of the Pdgfrβ receptor, Pdgfb ligand, endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2) and ligand (Vegfa) in trained wildtype and mutant levels using qPCR and in situ hybridization, to test whether these key molecules for vascular growth are upregulated after exercise, commensurate with the increase in pericyte numbers and vessel network size as in Aim 1 and 2. This project tests early life endurance training on brain vascular development, and whether it can be used as a modifier of a genetic disease leading to stroke and neurodegeneration.","This project explores how exercise influences brain development in a laboratory animal model of young zebrafish related to stroke prevention. Brain vessels critically support neuronal function, and stroke arises when vessels are blocked or break. We study fish with a genetic mutation that leads to ischemic stroke that arises from small vessel disease in humans. We are testing whether endurance exercise can overcome the brain blood vessel defects in these fish and rescue brain defects. The findings will provide insight into the role of physical activity in early brain and vascular health which can be translated to humans to test whether exercise improves outcomes in at-risk populations.",,"Training, Exercise, Brain, Blood, Vascular, Vessel, Zebrafish, Pericytes, Genetic",Stroke,n,Brain Vessels,Endurance Exercise ,Genetics,Animal,,Mind and Body,University of Calgary,2025,"7,000.00","7,000.00",,,,,,,"7,000.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariam-alshaikh-241166220/,,,University of British Columbia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kirsten Krochak,She/Her,Vivian Mushahwar,Biomechanical and clinical outcomes of motor and sensory recovery from incomplete spinal cord injury using a novel simultaneous exercise and non-invasive neuromodulation rehabilitiation intervention,"Improving walking abilities after an incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) is one of the top desires of people with paraplegia. It improves quality of life of the affected individual and reduces secondary complications that impact both the affected person and their families as well as the health care system. Current interventions to improve walking ability after iSCI include gait specific training paradigms primarily focused on leg movement (Zhou et al.). They are often limited by therapist fatigue rather than patient fatigue and do not incorporate the coordination of the arms and legs present during walking and rhythmic movements. With these issues in mind, Dr. Mushahwar’s lab recently demonstrated for the first time, that arm and leg (A&L) cycling assisted with functional electrical stimulation (FES) doubles improvements in over-ground walking for persons with iSCI compared to legs-only cycling and gait-specific training paradigms. This project builds on these findings by incorporating transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) to the FES A&L cycling as neuromodulation of spinal pathways through non invasive spinal stimulation has shown to enhance signaling from the brain and facilitate rehabilitation after iSCI. It is anticipated that integrating FES A&L cycling with non-invasive neuromodulation can further enhance rehabilitative outcomes. One main goal of this project is to identify biomechanical changes in gait that occur across the 12-week novel rehabilitation intervention. Spinal cord injuries disrupt signaling between the brain and spinal cord that initiate and control walking resulting in disrupted gait patterns. Challenges such as toe-drop can arise and lead to falls, increasing health care resources required by persons with iSCI and decreasing their quality of life. We hypothesize that the addition of spinal stimulation through tSCS to FES A&L cycling will further improve the connectivity of neural networks between the brain, spinal cord and intraspinal networks therefore improving walking recovery beyond what is currently possible with available rehabilitation practices. Biomechanical gait characteristics will be compared to the group that underwent the FES A&L cycling intervention with no spinal stimulation carried out previously by Dr. Mushahwar’s lab. Over 12 weeks, participants with iSCI will undergo FES A&L cycling paired simultaneously with tSCS. Vicon Motion Capture and its marker based Plug-in-gait model, which is the gold-standard of motion capture technology, will be used to collect information on walking speed, step length, step time, support time, as well as ankle, hip and knee range of motion (ROM). Custom MATLAB code will be written to analyze the ROM of the joints individually, and also the inter-joint coordination through cyclograms. The biomechanical outcomes of this novel cost-effective intervention will reflect longitudinal changes in overground walking and determine the functional efficacy of tSCS in further facilitating walking recovery. Changes in clinical outcomes across the 12-week rehabilitation intervention will also be analyzed to determine changes in functional mobility. The primary outcome measures for walking will include the 10-meter walk test (10MWT) to assess walking speed and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess walking endurance. The International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) is a standard clinical tool that will be used to assess changes in sensory function throughout the intervention. The Berg Balance Scale will be used to assess changes in balance, dynamometry for changes in strength, the Modified Ashworth scale to assess spasticity, and the Modified Spinal Cord Injury Functional Ambulation Profile (mSCI-FAP) to assess obstacle navigation ability. Changes to quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L. If successful, this rehabilitation strategy could directly benefit members of the SCI community who engage in the intervention. These benefits could include the reduction of risk for secondary complications of SCI like pressure injuries, as well as improvements in sensorimotor function, balance, locomotor abilities and the cardiovascular benefits of exercise. This intervention which integrates two rehabilitative technologies, is directly translatable to clinical rehabilitation centers like the Glenrose rehabilitation hospital and outpatient rehabilitation services provided in physiotherapy clinics.","Improving walking abilities after an iSCI (Spinal Cord Injury) improves quality of life, reduces secondary complications, and is one of the top desires of people with paraplegia. Dr. Mushahwar’s lab recently showed that incorporating arm and leg coordination into a cycling training intervention improved walking two times the amount that traditional gait-specific training has achieved. The research aim is to further reactivate neural networks by adding transcutaneous (i.e., through the skin) spinal cord stimulation to the electrical-stimulation-facilitated arm and leg cycling.","rehabilitation, gait ","Walking, Spinal, Rehabilitation, Cycling, FES",Spinal Cord Injury,n,Neuroplasticity,"tSCS, Cycling Training",Mobility,Human,,Mind and Body,University of Alberta,2025,"7,000.00","1,500.00",,,,,,,"1,500.00","7,000.00",Undergraduate,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,kkrochak@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robert Moore,,"Sean Dukelow, Tyler Cluff",Podcast,"Knowledge translation is a cornerstone of science. A key aspect of knowledge translation is the communication of 
scientific ideas which can lead to the development of 
new theories, foster innovation, and play a role in policy 
decisions. Importantly, knowledge translation serves as 
an avenue through which research can directly impact 
the well-being of the general public. Thus, it is important 
that researchers and trainees actively engage with the 
public and enable them to voice their questions and 
concerns about research that will impact their day-to-day 
lives. Historically, one of the more common ways of 
engaging the public has been in-person communication 
(e.g. information and Q&A sessions, youth science 
camps and science fairs, school science programs, 
etc…). The COVID-19 pandemic has restricted many of 
these in-person events and has reduced opportunities 
for community outreach. This has changed the ways in 
which researchers and trainees engage with the public. 
Online forms of communication present as a pragmatic 
means of increasing engagement amongst researchers, 
trainees, and the general public. Communication 
technologies have seen tremendous advancements in 
the past few decades. This has prompted many 
researchers to re-imagine how science is 
communicated. The pandemic has accelerated this 
process, leading to a surge in online research content 
(e.g. online conferences, educational videos, and podcasts). The growing popularity of online content 
suggests that these new forms of communication may 
become increasingly important for knowledge translation 
in the future. Despite this, research training does not 
provide opportunities to develop the skills necessary for 
producing online content. Indeed, few educational 
videos and podcasts feature trainees and far less are 
produced by trainees. Thus, a program aimed at 
developing online science content that is run by trainees, 
for trainees, would not only provide a platform for 
individuals to share their research, but also an avenue to 
develop skills associated with producing online science 
content. 
The On the Brain podcast has recently begun 
production. Each episode features trainees from various 
disciplines of neuroscience and is produced by a team 
of trainees. This project will provide trainees the 
opportunity to plan and host episodes, work with audio 
and visual equipment, and use audio and video editing 
software to produce episodes. As of writing, the team 
has produced two pilot episodes and have additional 
episodes planned for the upcoming year. Given the 
strong presence of nutriceutical, neurotechnology, and 
precision medicine research at the University of Calgary, 
we plan to feature trainees from these research fields. 
The project will fill a gap in research training by providing 
an alternative means through which trainees can share 
their research with the public during and after the 
pandemic. Furthermore, trainees working on producing 
episodes develop a unique skillset that is rarely provided 
in most research training programs. Taken together, this 
project will help trainees refine their communication skills 
while preparing them to share their research across 
different online platforms throughout their careers. The 
ways in which scientific knowledge is translated is 
evolving; how we teach knowledge translation to 
aspiring scientists should also evolve.","Research training programs do not emphasize alternative mediums like social media, videos, and podcasts for translating knowledge. The On the Brain podcast is a student led project designed to teach aspiring researchers necessary skills to produce online scientific content.",,,,,,,,,,,University of Calgary,2022,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,Impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it's not just resting that's important—brain activity during sleep is also critical. During sleep, different parts of the brain produce rhythmic patterns of activity called brain waves. These brain waves work to solidify our memories so they’re more stable over the long-term. Cannabis is a popular sleep aid, but it’s also known to impair memory. To understand how this might happen, we take recordings of brain waves from animals in a sleep-like state and compare them before and after giving tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis.

According to Statistics Canada, racialized groups comprised 26.6% of the total population in 2021; experiences of racial discrimination, systemic inequities, socioeconomic struggles, discrimination, and the lasting impacts of colonization, were linked to poorer mental and physical health outcomes in this group. Youth from these communities are at a particular disadvantage, as they must navigate and grow up in environments shaped by these inequities. To address this disparity, it is crucial to empower marginalized youth with the tools needed to learn more about health equity and be advocates for change. So, my proposed project, the CHILD-BRIGHT EDI-DI Youth Empowerment Program seeks to equip youth with the resources needed to develop/spread knowledge translation tools to inspire more communities to address health inequities, specifically in the context of brain-based disability research. The CHILD-BRIGHT EDI-DI Youth Empowerment Program aims to teach youth aged 16-25 from equity- deserving groups (e.g., racialized, low socioeconomic, and immigrant communities) about the importance of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Decolonization-Indigenization (EDI-DI) in brain-based disability research. To bring this vision to life, I will partner with the CHILD-BRIGHT Network, which has resources on EDI-DI in health research and expertise in knowledge translation. This collaboration will provide the necessary support to guide the youth throughout the program. The program will begin with youth completing an application form. From this applicant pool, we’ll select 10 youth to participate. After selection, participants will attend an orientation to learn about the program structure and EDI-DI’s role in health research. The youth will then engage in workshops and webinars covering topics like the significance of EDI-DI in research, healthcare disparities, and best practices for knowledge translation. After completing several workshops, each participant will choose a relevant topic within brain-based disability research (e.g., the lack of mental health resources in racialized communities) to further research. With this knowledge, the youth will create a knowledge translation (KT) tool—such as an infographic, video, or podcast—to convey their findings. These tools will be featured on the CHILD-BRIGHT website, helping to educate others about disparities in brain-based disability research and how to integrate EDI-DI practices. At the end of the program, a final virtual meeting/symposium will be held, where participants can present their work to fellow youth, community members, and CHILD-BRIGHT staff. This symposium will serve as a platform for youth to share their work, inspire others, and cultivate a sense of agency and empowerment as advocates for health equity. The program benefits underrepresented youth and the broader community by raising awareness of health disparities in neurological research to inspire change. Month 0 Finalize program structure, curriculum, and workshop materials. Open the application for youth participants. Month 1,2 Review applications and select approximately 10 youth participants. Orientation Start bi- weekly workshops and webinars on EDI- DI, health disparities, and knowledge translation. Youth will choose a research topic related to EDI-DI in brain-based disability research and begin their independent research. Month 3 Rounding up the webinars + developing knowledge translation tools (infographic, video, podcast, etc) Month 4 Host a virtual symposium where participants present their work to peers, community members, and CHILD-BRIGHT staff. Feature the knowledge translation tools on the CHILD-BRIGHT website. Honorarium for Youth Participants: One of the program’s key goals is to empower youth from equity-deserving groups. Providing an honorarium supports this by recognizing their time, labour, and lived experience as valuable. It also removes financial barriers that might otherwise prevent them from engaging fully, ensuring the program remains accessible to those who have historically been excluded from similar opportunities. Honorarium for Guest Speakers and Workshop Hosts: To effectively teach EDI-DI principles and health equity, the program relies on knowledgeable facilitators, many of whom come from the same underrepresented communities as the participants. Compensating speakers fairly reinforces the program’s commitment to equity and inclusion, and ensures that the educational content about EDI-DI and neurological research is grounded in lived experience and authentic community engagement. Accessibility Accommodations: Since the program is rooted in Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Decolonization- Indigenization, it must be accessible to all youth, including those with disabilities. Accessibility accommodations—such as captioning, ASL interpretation, or screen-reader friendly materials—ensure that every participant can fully benefit from the program’s resources, aligning with the goal of creating inclusive spaces in health research. Access to Premium Design Software: A major outcome of the program is the development of knowledge translation (KT) tools by youth. Providing access to professional design software allows participants to create high-quality, impactful tools that effectively communicate their research to broader communities. This directly supports the goal of inspiring action through accessible and visually engaging health education resources. Ads and Promotional Material: To reach youth from marginalized communities— especially those who may not already be plugged into existing academic or research networks—intentional outreach is essential. Promotional materials and targeted ads help the program connect with the youth it aims to serve, supporting equitable access and encouraging diverse participation across the GTHA and beyond.",,,,Mental Health,y,N/A,KT Workshops,"Youth Empowerment, Knowledge Translation",,,Mind and Body,University of Toronto,2025,5000,5000,,,,,,,"5,000.00","5,000.00",Impact,,,,,https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=9LAJwk8AAAAJ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lola-i-b9707b269/,,,University of Toronto,,,,lolairelewuyi@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ranita Manocha,,Ranita Manocha,Knowledge translation resources to improve the lives of walking aid users,"Over 1.2 million Canadians use walking
aids such as walkers, canes, and
crutches[1]. Although walking aids might
offload a weak, injured or operated lower
limb, our research has shown that
walking aid use also results in abnormal
repetitive upper limb loading[2], which
may cause secondary pain or injury[3].
Improper walking aid use has also been
associated with increased risk of
falling[4], potentially resulting in fracture
or brain injury[5]. Our research has
shown that many patients do not receive
instruction on how to safely fit or walk
with their walking aids[6], and that this

may present a risk factor for walking aid-
associated injury[3]. Our research has

also shown that many healthcare
providers that distribute walking aids,
especially nurses and pharmacists, do
not receive adequate education on these
devices[7]. Our research team has
developed a community educational
program called Improving Canadians’
Walking Aid Skills, Learning, and
Knowledge© (ICanWALK©) to help

address these gaps[8]. The target end-
users of our free educational products

are walking aid users, their caregivers
and peers, clinicians-in-training, and
clinicians. Mobile apps have been shown
to promote physical activity, improve
self-efficacy and increase treatment
adherence in healthcare settings[9]. Our
ICanWALK© app is a free, interactive
video- and self-assessment-based
mobile application that teaches people
how to safely fit and walk with walking
aids[10]. The app contains 34 modules,
spanning a variety of aids and skills, and
is available in English, French, and
Spanish. With our app, the user watches
an instructional video on the skill with
key components highlighted; has a video
taken of themselves performing the skill;

and then compares the two videos side-
by-side, while answering a series of

questions to evaluate their performance.
The ICanWALK© app has improved
balance confidence, walking aid fitting
ability, and confidence in walking with a walking aid amongst walking aid
users[6]. The app has also been used
with 60 healthcare trainees in Calgary
and Quebec City[11] and downloaded by
34 members of the public. Three patient
partners and 4 clinicians have been
involved in developing the app[6]. In
December 2024 we created an additional
21 modules on skills such as going up
and down stairs and getting out of a
chair with a variety of walking aids, but
currently these are only available in
English. Our patient partners have also
helped create 12 ICanWALK©
brochures[12] to educate walking aid
users on how to fit their devices (axillary
crutches, forearm crutches, cane,
walker, walking poles, knee scooter; in
English and Spanish). They have also
helped us create 4 ICanWALK© YouTube
videos to provide education on walking
aid skills to the public. We would like to
use the Impact Grant to help promote
the ICanWALK© app, brochures, and
educational videos to our target
audiences; translate the app content to
increase community uptake; and create
10 more online videos. In particular,
people living in rural and remote
locations or on limited incomes often
have difficulties accessing clinicians[13]
for walking aid education, and this grant
will help us make such education easily
accessible at no cost.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tech, Mind and Body",,2025,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avril Mansfield,,Avril Mansfield,An updated clinical toolkit to facilitate using reactive balance training in clinical practice,"People with neurological conditions,
including stroke, traumatic brain injury,
and spinal cord injury, often have
balance impairments and are at
increased risk of falling. While some falls
can result in devastating physical
injuries, pervasive fear of falling can lead
to reduced willingness to walk
independently, deconditioning, and
functional decline.1 Falls happen when
someone fails to recover from a loss of
balance.2 We pioneered a novel balance
training approach, called reactive
balance training, where people
repeatedly lose their balance so that
they can practice and improve the
quality of fast balance reactions to
prevent falling.3 We found that reactive
balance training is the only type of
exercise that can improve these fast
balance reactions,4,5 and that it can
prevent falls in daily life by about 40%
among older adults and people with
neurological conditions.6 Therefore,
there is good evidence that reactive
balance training should be implemented
in neurorehabilitation practice. However,
we also found that many
physiotherapists and kinesiologists who
treat clients with balance problems lack
the skills and knowledge to use reactive
balance training in practice.7,8 These
findings led us to develop a clinical
toolkit for healthcare professionals to
learn how about reactive balance training
and how to use it in practice.9 The
toolkit includes videos, a manual,
treatment planning guide, and sample
training logs. The toolkit has been
accessed almost 10,000 times in 66
countries around the world to date. Since
first being created almost 5 years ago,
new evidence has emerged about the
benefits of reactive balance training and
how to implement it into practice. The
purpose of this project is to update the
toolkit based on new evidence, and to
translate it into French to enable
clinicians across Canada to access
information within the toolkit. We will first
conduct an updated literature search to
identify new clinical trials and systematic
reviews of reactive balance training. We will then incorporate the findings of
these studies into the revised toolkit
manual and introductory video. In our
previous survey, we found that clinicians
prefer to learn about reactive balance
training from watching instructional
videos.7 Therefore, we will create new
videos that summarize the updated
evidence for reactive balance training,
and will incorporate new video clips that
we have collected over the past five
years demonstrating different training
approaches. Finally, we will translate all
documents and videos into French. The
final toolkit will be available for free on
our website. We will advertise the toolkit
within Canada through healthcare
professional associations (e.g., Canadian
Physiotherapy Association, Canadian
Kinesiology Alliance) and more broadly
through social media (e.g., LinkedIn,
Bluesky).",,,,,,,,,,,"Tech, Mind and Body",University of Toronto,,2000,2000,,,,,,,"2,000.00","2,000.00",Impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
